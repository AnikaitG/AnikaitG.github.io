    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> are a pair of elegant women's shoes made of a red enameled leather that glistens in the light. People who gaze at the shoes are filled with an overwhelming urge to put them on. If someone puts them on, sharp teeth will extend from the interior of the shoes and bite into the ankles of the wearer, latching on to them.</p>

      <p>After wearing the shoes, the wearer will experience a sharp increase in all their desires, including those which they would not normally act upon. Due to an increase in aggression, these desires are usually carried out in a violent manner.</p>

      <p>The shoes are incredible difficult to remove on account of the teeth digging into their victim's ankles. This often leads to an individual needing to be dismember the wearer's feet to remove the shoes; whether so as to suppress them, or to take the shoes for themselves. The shoes are also known to be able to cut themselves of the ankles of their host to run away should they need to.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 4-6 {RED} damage and produces a maximum of 16 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Instinct} (High) > {Insight} (Common) > {Attachment} (Low) > {Repression} (Very Low).<br>It perfers work performed by lower level agents, except for {Instinct} where higher level agents are preferred.</p>

      <p>The {abnoName} are kept on a stuffed cushion which sits on a simple white podium. If an employee with low {Temperance} finishes a work the them, they will be unable to resist the urge to put on the shoes. This will cause {abnoName} to breach containment as their host walks out of the containment unit wearing them. The wearer will roam around the facility carrying an axe that they will use to attack other employees, and to dismember their feet after killing them (presumably to ensure that the shoes will remain theirs alone). The employee will need to be killed in order to return {abnoName} to the containment unit.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 1.<br>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} will enchant a random employee with low {Temperance}. The enchanted employee will start making their way to {abnoName}' containment unit to put them on, which will cause them to breach. Enchanted employees can be repeatedly clicked on to snap them out of their trance.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>When an employee with {Temperance} Level 2 finished the work, they went insane, and the {abnoName} remembered its previous owner.</li>
        <li>When the work result was {Normal}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased with a normal probability.</li>
        <li>When the work result was {Bad}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased with a high probability.</li>
        <li>When the Qliphoth Counter reached 0, an employee with {Temperance} Level 2 fell into a trance and walked into the containment unit.</li>
        <li>After continuously attempting to converse with an employee who had been enchanted by the {abnoNames}, they seemed to return to normal.</li>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>The Abnormality takes the form of a pair of elegant red women's shoes. The design is antique, but there's no telling where or how they were made.</p>

        <p>When observing the shoes, a strong urge to try them on is induced. The changes that occur from wearing the Abnormality are first visible in the eyes of the wearer.</p>

        <p>The next observable change is that the wearer is unwilling to remove the shoes. They will also act upon any and all desires they may have. If someone attempts to hamper them from acting on their desires or tries to remove the shoes, the shoes will take control of its host which sometimes leads to murder.</p>

        <p>It is unknown whether the host's will is involved in the process, but considering the sharp increase of desire and aggression, the host's primal urges seem to remain intact.</p>

        <p>&lt;Employee F-1230 Counselling Log&gt;<br>
        “&lt;Redacted&gt; was a kind person. Well, they were kind of a celebrity actually. They always told us that our jobs were something to be proud of. And they always knew how to deal with the Abnormalities… But letting them enter that containment unit was our biggest mistake. We didn't think that a pair of shoes could do any harm. The next thing we knew, &lt;Redacted&gt; was wearing the shoes, grinning from ear to ear. It was a strange sight. That smile wasn't real, it was… (Omitted)<br>
        There was blood everywhere. The tapping of the shoes echoed in the corridor. I closed my eyes and played dead. When I peeked, I saw one my colleague's head rolling across the floor. Then the shoes stopped right in front of me, and they stood still for a long time. Finally, they walked past me, and that was when I passed out. (Omitted)<br>
        I head they had to cut off &lt;Redacted&gt;'s feet in order to remove the shoes. No one has seen them since, but those of us who've been here long enough would still remember that incident.”</p>

        <p>&lt;Footage from Corridor Camera Z3-493&gt;<br>
        &lt;Redacted1&gt;: “So all the work on your part is done? I've just finished mine. The <a href="profile.html?abno=Scorched Girl">little match girl</a> is still in the same state though. It's so frustrating. Let's go grab a cup of coffee at the lounge.”<br>
        &lt;Redacted2&gt;: “You know &lt;Redacted1&gt;, there's something I've been thinking about for a long time.”<br>
        &lt;Redacted1&gt;: “Let's talk when we get to the lounge, I'm just too tired right now. Hey, why are you wearing shoes like that? Only staff footwear is allowed to be worn during work.”<br>
        &lt;Redacted2&gt;: “That's not important right now. What's important is that we're alone right now.”<br>
        &lt;Redacted1&gt;: “What are you on about? Listen, I'm gonna head to the lounge and take a break… Wait, what exactly are you wearing? You didn't wear 'it', did you!?”<br>
        &lt;Redacted2&gt;: “&lt;Redacted1&gt;, I've liked you for a long time.”<br>
        &lt;Redacted1&gt;: “Damnit, take them off right now. Do you realise what you're doing right now?”<br>
        &lt;Redacted2&gt;: “I thought about why you didn't like me back. It's because of Emily, isn't it? You're too distracted by Emily, that you never even noticed me, right?”<br>
        &lt;Redacted1&gt;: “Is that a weapon you're holding? And your ankles are starting to bleed too, please take them off!”<br>
        &lt;Redacted2&gt;: “So all I need to do is get rid of Emily. Just wait a moment, it won't take long. You just stay right here.”<br>
        &lt;Redacted1&gt;: “Please, don't do this. Don't make me hurt you.”<br>
        &lt;Redacted2&gt;: “If you wanted to stop me, you should've done that the day we first met.”</p>

        <p>&lt;Redacted2&gt; then knocked out &lt;Redacted1&gt; with the weapon and went to the lounge. Fortunately, no one else, including Emily, was harmed. &lt;Redacted2&gt; was soon removed from the company's database. She confessed that she was entirely aware of what she was doing, and that the shoes only encouraged her to do what she always desired. When she was suppressed by the response team, the shoes ran away, cutting themselves off of her ankles in the process. It took a total of 23 minutes for them to be suppressed and returned to their containment unit. &lt;Redacted2&gt; died from excessive blood loss. &lt;Redacted1&gt; only suffered minor injuries but quit the job due to trauma.</p>

        <p>&lt;Excerpt from Research Log X3-39&gt;<br>
        We received reports that Employee F-4002 had been enchanted by the shoes and was now roaming around in the corridor. We immediately ordered Employee F-3054 to suppress her. She was a veteran employee with vast experience in suppressions. We expected her to be able to suppress the problem employee with little to no trouble. However, she did not return. When others went to search for her, they found Employee F-4002 laying unconcious with both her ankles severed, while Employee F-3054 was maniacally trying to remove the shoes from the severed feet.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the second Abnormality on the {Floor of Literature}, unlocking {Breakdown Glitter}, {Breakdown Obsession}, and {Breakdown Axe} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, each shoe is worn by a black-coloured leg that has been chopped at the knee. The bone of the upper leg still remains, which is used as a handle for a bloodied axe. The Left Shoe and the Right Shoe are present as separate entities, with the only visual difference being that the Left Shoe has teeth around the hole of the shoe and across the handle of its axe.</p>

      <p>The Left Shoe only has one attack which will inflict {LoR SE d Bleed} upon anyone it hits. The Right Shoe will always prioritize targets that have {LoR SE d Bleed}, and its attack either gain additional Power if used against a target with {LoR SE d Bleed}, or will allow it to heal itself according to how much {LoR SE d Bleed} the target has.<br>
      Due to the Right Shoe's Speed being fixed at 1, it is easy to redirect its attacks to a librarian without {LoR SE d Bleed} in order to avoid the additional effects of its attacks.</p>
