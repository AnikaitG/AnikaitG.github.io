    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> appears as a large black 'bulb', resembling a spider's egg sac, that hangs by a long, thin thread from the ceiling. It has numerous red eyes scattered across its body. They are vertical, of different sizes, and glow in the dark.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} has a strong maternal instinct, and is always looking to feed and protects its offspring. The spiderlings are small spiders that skitter around the ground. {abnoName} uses its several eyes to keep track of all its young, and to keep a watch of any potential prey.</p>

      <p>Should anyone squash a spiderling, {abnoName} will descend from the ceiling to grab them. It will then fully encase them in its web, and leave the cocooned victim as a meal for its spiderlings to feast on.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 2-3 {RED} damage and produces a maximum of 14 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Instinct} (High) > {Attachment} (Common) > {Repression} (Common) > {Insight} (Very Low).</p>

      <p>The containment unit is very dark, obscuring the Abnormality from view. {abnoName} hides up in the ceiling while its spiderling crawl across the floor.<br>If an employee with low {Prudence} work with the Abnormality, of if an employee performs {Insight} work, they will end up squashing some spiderling. As a result, {abnoName} will descend from above and whisk them away. A couple of seconds later, a cocoon will drop down from the ceiling with the employee trapped inside.<br>
      Cocooned employees are considered dead, and they will disappear by the next work day. For every employee cocooned by {abnoName}, an additional PE-Box will be produced at the end of each work for the day.</p>
      
      <p>It does not have a Qliphoth Counter, and does not breach containment.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Employees with {Prudence} Level 1 stomped on the crawling spiderlings. {abnoName} turned those who harmed its children into cocoons.</li>
        <li>When the employee cleaned the unit as part of {Insight} Work, {abnoName} turned them into a cocoon.</li>
        <li>{abnoName}'s cocoons produce PE-Boxes. The more cocoons there are, the more PE-Boxes are produced.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>The Abnormality takes the form of a giant spider, guarding its domain in darkness. Small spiderlings skitter around the floor while unidentified wires hang from the ceiling. It's difficult to make out the Abnormality as the cables running through the ceiling of the containment unit are damaged, denying illuination.</p>

        <p>Our proud employee Peter entered the Abnormality's containment unit and saw the spiderlings scattering away from the light that came through the door. As soon as Peter squashed one of the spiderlings, a horrible thing occurred.<br>
        A giant spider with many eyes descended from the ceiling and took Peter back up with it in a matter of seconds. The spider gleefully wove him into a cocoon. The cocooned employee hanging from the ceiling of the containment unit will make a healthy meal for the spider's offspring.</p>

        <p>Unsurprisingly, not a single employee volunteered to retrieve the corpse of their cocooned colleague.</p>

        <p>Most people don't realise, but the victims trapped inside cocoons are not dead. They're kept fresh for later consumption, as they slowly die within. Spider venom contains a special toxin that permanently damages the heart, eventually leading to death. The victim trapped inside the cocoon has no choice but to wait in the dark for the spiderlings to consume them, listening to the slow beating of their own heart.</p>

        <p>&lt;Excerpt from a letter&gt;<br>
        Thank you for sharing your opinion, however our own research indicates that your concerns are unlikely to be true. Furthermore, it has been proven that the presence of a cocoon inside the containment unit increases the energy output. For these reasons we will implement a rescue procedure for the employees caught by {abnoName}, as this goes against out interests. However, we will allocate more resources into the research of this Abnormality in the future as per your suggestion. Please be advised that your actions go against the code of conduct and are subject to penalties including dismissal. Lobotomy Corporation always values the wellfare and voice of its employees.<br>- Head of the Welfare Department, Lobotomy Corporation</p>

        <p>There's an eerie rumour spreading among employees. It's not surprising for rumours to spread in a company such as this, but it's interesting that the number of alleged witnesses seems to multiply. Following are some of the rumours that are circulating:<br>
        “Whispers can be heard in the containment unit at night.”<br>
        “It was the voice of Alex, who went missing a few days ago…”<br>
        “They say the voice was weeping in terror, begging to be saved from the darkness.”</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the third Abnormality on the {Floor of Literature}, unlocking {Awakening Cocoon}, {Awakening Meal}, and {Awakening Alertness} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} is accompanied by four Spiderlings. It intially starts as inactive and untargetable, being out of reach, while the Spiderlings attack the librarians for nutrition. When a Spiderling is killed, {abnoName} becomes active which also makes it susceptible to damage. It will target the librarian that dealt the killing blow to the Spiderling with '<span class="hardcover">Catching Food</span>'. This is a high rolling attack that can be difficult to counter.</p>

      <p>When a librarian is hit by '<span class="hardcover">Catching Food</span>', they are inflicted with the {LoR SE d Cocoon} status for the next turn. With this status, the librarian will become Staggered and all Spiderlings will target them. The Spiderlings also have the ability to inflict a heavy amount of {LoR SE d Bind} on to targets '<span class="hardcover">Thin Webbing</span>', which can prevent librarians from redirecting the Spiderlings' attacks to protect their cocooned ally.</p>
