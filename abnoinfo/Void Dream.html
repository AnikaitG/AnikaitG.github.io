    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> has the appearance of a sheep with white wool and purple skin. The Abnormality is always seen floating in the air asleep. While the head's eyes are always closed, it has two additional eyes embedded in its wool, one with a pink iris and another with a green iris. It has small legs that are mostly obscured by its wool, a pair of curled horns, and long, thin tail curled inwards.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} is not directly hostile, though it has the ability to put people to sleep. The dreams it provides are so sweet that some never reawaken. If {abnoName} is harmed, it transforms into a more hostile second form.</p>

      <p>Upon transforming, the wool turns into fur, as a second head resembling that of a rooster's emerges from the Abnormality's rear side. The eyes on the original head open up to reveal black, empty sockets with a long, thin, black tail emerging out from one of them. The eyes embedded on the body lose their glossy look, and two more eyes are present on the base of the neck of the new head, a blue one and a yellow one. Finally, the Abnormality no longer floats as its previously small legs extended down to the floor, ending in hooves.</p>

      <p>In its second form, {abnoName} no longer puts people to sleep but instead wakes them with its crowing. This method of waking causes them to panic.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 1-3 {BLACK} damage and produces a maximum of 14 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Attachment} (High) > {Instinct} (Common) = {Insight} (Common) > {Repression} (Low).</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 2.<br>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} breaches containment. It will peacefully roam around the facility, not attacking anyone. Occassionally it will create a burst of light particles that travel across the facility putting anyone who comes into contact with them asleep. Employees who fall asleep this way can be woken up by repeatedly clicking on them. After a while, {abnoName} will voluntarily return to its containment unit by itself.</p>

      <p>If {abnoName} is harmed during its breach, it transforms into its second form. This form is hostile and will no longer recontain itself, requiring a suppression. It will occasionally crow causing {WHITE} damage to all employees in the same department. If any employees that were asleep due to the Abnormality's effect hear its cry, they will wake up and instantly panic.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>When an employee with {Temperance} below Level 2 finished the work, they fell asleep never to reawaken.</li>
        <li>When the work result was {Bad}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>After escaping, {abnoName}'s light put every employee who made contact with it asleep. They woke up after the manager repeatedly shook them.</li>
        <li>{abnoName} eventually returned to its containment unit of its own volition.</li>
        <li>&lt;Warning&gt; When suppression was attempted on the Abnormality, it transformed and became extremely hostile.</li>
        <li>After transforming, {abnoName} would occasionally crow, inflicting {WHITE} damage to all employees in the department. Those who were asleep due to the Abnormality's light awoke and panicked after hearing the noise.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>"I want to sleep forever."<br>"Don't try to wake me."</p>

        <p>The Abnormality resembles a sheep with its wool and horns. It's doesn't look very special appearance-wise aside from the additional eyes embedded into its body.<br>Gaining information about this Abnormality is expected to be difficult due to its never-ending slumber.</p>

        <p>The following report illustrates how {abnoName}'s ability to put people to sleep affects employees physiologically. It appears it won't be possible to utilize this ability for reducing the mental strain of employees. Please refer to the report for further explanation:</p>

        <p>Vincent: Please, make it quick… I need to go back to sleep.</p>
        <p>Counselor: Is that because of the Abnormality?</p>
        <p>Vincent: Yes, I recall something looking like a sheep passing by me and… I fell asleep. I've been like this ever since.</p>
        <p>Counselor: Do you remember the dream you had back then?</p>
        <p>Vincent: I could never forget that dream.</p>
        <p>Counselor: Then could you tell me as much as you can about it, please?</p>
        <p>Vincent: It was a happy dream. That's all I really need to say to describe it. I even felt glad to be working for this company. He was there with me too, even though he's no longer around… (Omitted) …Because of that, I couldn't get a hold of myself after waking up.</p>
        <p>Counselor: I see. Lately, I've been hearing about you from other employees. They say that all you do outside of your working hours is sleep. Could you tell me about that, please?</p>
        <p>Vincent: Didn't you understand what I've been talking about? I want to have that dream again. That dream where I was with him. Those happy moments… But I can't see it, no matter how much I sleep.</p>
        <p>Counselor: …I see. I'd advise you to take some rest in your room.</p>
        <p>Vincent: …Every employee who woke up from hearing that Abnormality's cry went mad. People think it was because they had a terrible nightmare, but it's actually the complete opposite. The waking reality was so terrible, that the soul gave up on it.<br>As you know, time passes differently in dreams. A mere instant in reality can equal an eternity in a dream. If {abnoName} puts me to sleep again, then maybe I can have that wonderful dream again.</p>
        <p>Counselor: …I'll prescribe you some medicine. It will help you fall asleep. Please, get some rest. Additionally, you are prohibited from entering any containment units for the time being.</p>

        <p>Following the counselling session, employee Vincent had disobeyed safety orders and was found dead in {abnoName}'s containment unit.</p>

        <p>A demon changes form to deceive.<br>A demon shows sweet dreams to deceive.<br>A crack forms in the human mind when it is shown a dream it yearns for.<br>A demon doesn't let this chance pass by to bring them to their doom.</p>

        <p>Don't overcomplicate it. Don't say such scary things.<br>All I want is to give people sweet dreams, the dreams they wish for.<br>Those who've had my dreams always return to me.<br>So, close your eyes…</p>

        <p>In the dream, you were smiling brightly, and we had such a lively chat.<br>In the waking world, I recalled how you no longer existed and the happiness was replaced by a void.<br>Every morning, I try to force myself back to sleep. But I realised the world will never change.<br>I think that's when my soul started to crumble.<br>I've only been pretending to be fine, but my soul has been shattered into pieces ever since that day.<br>My yearning for you has become too much. I can't go back to who I was before.<br>Counselling, rest… It's all meaningless.<br>I spent days agonising over it until I came to a realisation.<br>It baited me with the promise of taking away my nightmares.<br>It left me in this void, to ensure I would return to it.<br>Then, I have already lost to it. I don't want to know anything anymore.<br>Please, eat my dreams.</p>
