    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> has the appearance of a female mercenary wearing a red, tattered cloak. The cloak's hood obscures the upper half of its face, leaving only the right eye visible. The lower half of the face is covered by a mask which has a design resembling sharp teeth. The Mercenary's arms and legs are completely wrapped in bandages, leaving no skin exposed. Its body is covered in scars which is why the Mercenary makes sure that no part is visible.</p>

      <p>Red Hood is highly capable in combat and takes requests or contracts to hunt down specific targets. It is typically armed with dual pistols and a retractable sickle to take down its prey. While Red Hood generally shows no hostility towards non-targets, it becomes extremely aggressive when it comes across <a href="profile.html?abno=Big and Might be Bad Wolf">Big and Might be Bad Wolf</a>.</p>

      <p>Exacting revenge on the Wolf is essentially Red Hood's sole purpose in life. Fueled by its hatred, it will immediately refocus all of its efforts into killing the Wolf regardless of who else gets caught in the crossfire. If the Wolf is taken down by someone else, Red Hood will enter an enraged state and attack all others indiscriminately until it itself is taken down as well.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 4-6 {RED} damage and produces a maximum of 20 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Insight} (Common) > {Instinct} (Common) > {Repression} (Low) > {Attachment} (Very Low).</p>

      <p>{Attachment} cannot be performed directly on Red Hood. Instead, the option is replaced by {Request} which allows Red Hood to be contracted to eliminate any hostile entity. Red Hood's contracts require energy as payment with the amount scaling with the risk level of the target. Once the request has been made, Red Hood will run out from its containment unit and rush towards the target. It will exclusively attack its target, dealing no damage to any employess in the way. Once the target has been eliminated, Red Hood will return to its containment unit by itself.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 3.<br>It will decrease by 1 each time an Abnormality escapes. Upon reaching 0 this way, {abnoName} breaches containment and marks the first entity it sees as its target. It will relentlessly chase down the target, not directly damaging other entities though they may still get hurt if caught in its attacks. Once it eliminates its target, it will select the next entity it sees as its new target.</p>

      <p>If Red Hood crosses paths with the Wolf at any point, it will enter an enraged state dealing increased damage and faster movement speed. The same will occur if the Wolf howls near its containment unit which will cause Red Hood to instantly breach containment. It will exclusively focus on the Wolf, ignoring any other entities but still dealing damage to them if they are caught in the crossfire.<br>
      Once Red Hood successfully suppressed the Wolf, it will willingly return to its containment unit. If the Wolf is instead suppressed by someone else, Red Hood will remain escaped and its attack power and movement speed will further increase.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>{abnoName} can be requested to suppress escaped Abnormalities or Ordeals. However, the request will be not be free.</li>
        <li>When an employee who had previously worked with <a href="profile.html?abno=Big and Might be Bad Wolf">F-02-58</a> finished the work, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>Every time another Abnormality escaped, the Qliphoth Counter decreased. However, it ignored the escape of <a href="profile.html?abno=Punishing Bird">O-02-56</a>.</li>
        <li>When F-02-58 howled near {abnoName}'s containment unit, the Qliphoth Counter dropped to 0.</li>
        <li>When encountering F-02-58, {abnoName} became even more aggressive.</li>
        <li>When someone other than {abnoName} suppressed F-02-58, it went into a fury and began attacking those around it indiscriminately.</li>

      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>“I’m a pro. I used to be expensive, but I'll cut you some slack under one condition. Hand that damn cunning bastard over to me if you ever see him. I’ll hang his head over my bed. Only then will I be able to sleep without having a nightmare.”</p>

        <p>A female warrior donned in a striking red hood. There are initials embroidered on her frayed and patched hood but they are unreadable due to the damage the hood has taken. Rumour has it that her hood use to be white, but turned red after being soaked in blood countless times.<br>→ This turned out to not be true. Fix this, Michael!</p>

        <p>Before coming to the city, she was a mercenary, wandering without residence. She does not trust others easily and has an extreme fondness for battle. She is unusually uncomfortable with any part of her body being exposed, or with looking at a mirror. Additionally, numerous symptoms of paranoia have been observed in her behaviour.<br>
        She has a strong desire to resolve emergency situations whenever they arise. She calls it a "contract". Since this behaviour consequently helps management, the company has recommended putting it to use.</p>

        <p>※ The following is a must-read for employees of all levels:<br>
        If she faces the "<a href="profile.html?abno=Big and Might be Bad Wolf">Big Bad Wolf</a>", she goes out of control. She will undergo an extreme shift in personality and several dangerous psychologically transitions. This encounter results in serious collateral damage, so it is advised to avoid any case where the two may face each other.</p>

        <p>“There'll be no victory to come from our battle. All I think about is how I'll kill that bastard in the most gruesome way possible. So, I won't raise any toast. I will not celebrate in any way. I got used to grinding the axe instead of picking flowers when I was 15.”</p>

        <a class="display-img" href="../images/abnos/Little Red Riding Hooded Mercenary/LoR Idle.png" data-lightbox="LoRIdle" data-title="{abnoName}"><img class="page-img" src="../images/abnos/Little Red Riding Hooded Mercenary/LoR Idle.png"/></a>

      </div>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of Language}, unlocking {Awakening Prey}, {Breakdown Vengeance}, and {Breakdown Ruddled Welts} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} acts as an ally of sorts as it is focused on fighting the Wolf in her Nightmares. Both Red Hood and the Wolf will primarily attack each other, though they also indirectly attack the librarians through their mass attacks. In order to successfully complete the suppression, the librarians must help Red Hood defeat the Wolf. If Red Hood is defeated by the Wolf, the battle ends in a loss.</p>

      <p>As the Wolf primarily targets Red Hood, the librarians need to redirect its attacks to ensure the Mercenary remains safe. It is capable of inflicting {LoR SE d Bind} through '<span class="hardcover">Cruel Claws</span>' which can hinder these efforts. It also uses Counter Block dice which can give the Wolf {LoR SE b Strength} the next turn. The librarians thus must be prepared to beat these dice when performing one-sided attacks.<br>
      Every few turns, the Wolf will use its mass attack '<span class="workofart">Howl</span>' which will greatly increase Red Hood's rage if it hits. Once the Wolf reaches half health, it will use '<span class="workofart">Howl</span>' every turn.</p>

      <p>Red Hood has the ability to inflict {LoR SE d Disarm} on the Wolf through '<span class="hardcover">Beast Hunt</span>' which will weaken the Wolf's Counter Block dice. It can also use '<span class="limited">Hollow-point Shell</span>' to break all the Wolf's dice, inflict {LoR SE d Fragile}, and deal a good amount of Stagger damage as well. Every few turns, it will use '<span class="workofart">Strike Without Hesitation</span>' which will also target librarians. Fortunately, this attack is fairly weak and can be easily countered. Alternatively, the librarians may allow themselves to be hit by this attack as Red Hood gains {LoR SE b Strength} for each target hit which can help it win clashes with the Wolf.<br>
      Red Hood also has a rage meter represented by a red filter applied to the background which will grow from left to right as it rises. The rage meter fills whenever Red Hood is hit by the Wold, and decreases when Red Hood successfully hits the Wolf. Once it is filled, Red Hood will enter a rage state where it gains 2 {LoR SE b Strength} and exclusively uses its mass attack '<span class="workofart">Bullet Shower</span>'. The rage state lasts for 2 turns after which it returns to its normal behaviour.</p>

      <p>If the Wolf is defeated by a librarian, the battle will not end, and Red Hood will enter a permament fury state. This is similar to the rage state, except it gains 5 {LoR SE b Strength} and increases its max HP and Stagger Resist. It is highly unlikely for the librarians to be able to defeat Red Hood in this state, so this situation must be avoided.</p>
