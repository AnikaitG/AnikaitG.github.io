    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is a large, brown teddy bear that is worn-out from years of neglect. When standing up it is taller than the average human, though it is often seen sitting and slouching. Its right ear is nibbled, and its right eye is missing with a big hole left in its place. Stuffing is seen peeking out from seams at multiple points. It also wears a tattered, green bowtie.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} is nostalgic for the old days, when it was loved by its previous owner and longs for affection. When it feels that it has found a new owner that loves it, Teddy will hug them tightly refusing to let go in fear of being abandoned again. This usually leads to target dying of asphyxiation.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 2-4 {WHITE} damage and produces a maximum of 15 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Attachment} (High) > {Repression} (Common) > {Insight} (Common) > {Instinct} (Very Low).<br>It perfers work performed by lower level agents.</p>

      <p>If the same employee enters Teddy's containment unit two times in a row, they receive a deathly embrace from the Abnormality which instantly kills them before they can start the work. In order to avoid this, employee should be assigned to work with {abnoName} in an alternating pattern.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>An Abnormality that resembles a large, raggedy teddy bear. It's missing some fur, and only has one eye.</p>

        <p>Judging from the worn ribbon around its neck, its former owner must have loved the bear very much. There's a name written on it, but the ribbon is too tattered to make it out. It seems the bear knows that it has been abandoned, and appears dejected.</p>

        <p>&lt;Employee M-2434 Counselling Log&gt;<br>
        “I was on night patrol duty. The teddy bear didn't require much attention, and was harmless most of the time. So all I did to check on it was glance inside its containment unit. I saw it was hugging someone. At first, I thought &lt;Redacted&gt; was simply working late. But then I felt that something was off. I yelled at &lt;Redacted&gt; to take a break, but they didn't respond. That's when I pressed the emergency button and called in reinforcements. &lt;Redacted&gt; had been dead for 8 hours. And for that whole duration, since the start of the work day till the moment I found them, they were being hugged by the bear.”</p>

        <p>&lt;Old Letter with a "Returned" Stamp&gt;<br>
        Remember Article 3 of the Employee Handbook?<br>"Do not feel attached to the Abnormalities."<br>I couldn't understand what that meant at first.<br>Do you think empathizing with those monsters is even possible?<br>Hey, that's what they are. It's okay to call them that when it's just you and me.<br>{abnoName} was your second Abnormality, right?<br>You must have thought that not all Abnormalities are monstrous after you saw it.<br>Seeing an abandoned teddy bear may have even stirred up some long lost memory of yours. Hey, I can understand that.<br>Anyways, it seemed that Teddy liked your hugs.<br>Yep, it would produce more energy when you were around.<br>And then they put you in charge of of the bear<br>You must have felt some kind of responsibility for it, right?<br>I started getting worried as the time you spent in its containment unit increased.<br>To me, it looked as if you were doing charity work for an oprhanage.<br>...<br>It seems the bear thought you were its new owner.<br>Maybe you'd be happy to hear that.<br>But it never wanted to be separated from its owner ever again.</p>

        <p>I know you probably promised to it that you'd return...<br>But it didn't understand. It can't understand.<br>I heard that, by some miracle, you survived the ordeal.<br>And that they spent an hour trying to separate you from its deadly embrace.<br>Even if others have forgotten about you...<br>I promise that I will always remember you.<br>I wish you well.<br>- K. H.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the second Abnormality on the {Floor of History}, unlocking {Awakening Nostalgic Embrace of the Old Days}, {Awakening Happy Memories}, and {Breakdown Display of Affection} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its combat encounter, {abnoName} is no longer slouching on the floor but instead is standing up, eager to 'play' with the librarians. Whenever a librarian clashes with {abnoName}, it will lower the Cost of '<span class="hardcover">Nostalgic Embrace of the Old Days</span>' regardless of whether it won or lost the clash. This is marked by hearts appearing above its head the next turn accompanied by the sound of a music box.</p>

      <p>As '<span class="hardcover">Nostalgic Embrace of the Old Days</span>' starts with a Cost of 5 {Light} and {abnoName} only has a maximum of 2 {Light}, it will be unable to use this attack until it has clashed at least 3 times. It is best to ignore Teddy's attacks, only clashing when absolutely necessary. Due to its high Speed its attacks cannot be redirected, meaning the targetted librarian will need to to endure the hits while their ally performs one-sided attacks against the teddy.</p>
