    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> has the appearance of an industrial meat grinder. It is cuboidal in shape, and supported by four legs. Two funnels are present, one coming out of the machine's right side and the other from the top on the left. The upper half of the machine is a lid which can open up perpendicular to the bottom half, along a visible circular black joint in the middle-left of the machine's body. The interior of the machine is lined with several saw blades.</p>

      <p>When approaching {abnoName}, an individual may feel a temptation to throw themselves into the machine. If they do so, the lid will close behind them and the machine will begin operation. While cutting up the individual inside, {abnoName} will produce music using the victim as its instrument. This music is highly addictive and will cause listeners to become enamoured by it. During the machine's operation, the blood of the victim is spewed out from the funnels. Once the machine fully digests its meal, there will be little to no trace of its victim.</p>

      <p>Individuals who are addicted to {abnoName}'s music will yearn to hear it again, and will attack others with the intent to feed them to the machine.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 4-6 {WHITE} damage and produces a maximum of 18 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Instinct} (High) > {Insight} (Common) > {Repression} (Common) > {Attachment} (Low).</p>

      <p>If an employee with low {Temperance} or high {Fortitude} works with {abnoName}, they will be unable to control themselves and jump into the machine. This leads to {abnoName} killing them and using them to play music. This will cause a random employee in the department to become addicted.</p>
        
      <p>The addicted employee will begin attacking the first other employee they see. After killing their target, the addicted employee will stuff them into a bag, drag them to {abnoName}'s containment unit, and toss them inside the machine. This will cause {abnoName} to play music once again, leading to another random employee getting addicted. The addicted employees will continue sacrificing other employees to {abnoName} until they are all killed.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 1.<br>Upon reaching 0, the next employee to enter its containment unit will immediately jump inside. Like above, this will generate music that will cause an employee to become addicted.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>An employee with {Fortitude} Level 4 or above dove into the {abnoName} to activate it after finishing their work.</li>
        <li>An employee with {Temperance} Level 2 or below dove into the {abnoName} to activate it after finishing their work.</li>
        <li>When the work result was {Bad}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>When the Qliphoth Counter reached 0, the next employee to enter the containment unit dove into the {abnoName} to activate it.</li>
        <li>While the {abnoName} was in operation, a nearby employee complained that she could hear a continuous melody. This melody also made another employee 'addicted'.</li>
        <li>An employee was knocked unconcious after being attacked by an addicted employee. After, the addicted employee threw the unconcious employee into the {abnoName}.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>The machine has the shape of a long cuboid. At first glance it may look like a simple industrial grinder, but the existence of its own "will" fulfills the criteria for it to be an Abnormality.</p>

        <p>When approached (further analysis is required to determine the actual perimeter) or touched, the employee will become delirious and throw themselves into the Abnormality. Afterwards, the machine's ventilation fan will shut off and it will begin operation. This takes approximately 5 minutes.</p>

        <p>After a few experiments, it was determined that the Abnormality desires to produce "music" from this interaction.</p>

        <p>There is no detailed research of the Abnormality's "music". However, it is theorised that the music has a special characteristic that attratcs people based on their specific behaviour or psychological records. If an employee has been determined to be addicted to the music, they must be treated immediately to prevent any collateral damage.</p>

        <p>&lt;Excerpt from Interview Log&gt;<br>
        “I was supposed to be sent in alone. The Abnormality looked rather unassuming. It was like a simple machine you might find in a factory, and it didn't react to anything. But that day, &lt;Redacted&gt; insisted that we had to go visit it. He kept talking about how "The Pale Horse" had responded to him. I didn't think it was considering me when it responded. Most of the Abnormalities that I'm assigned to are fairly safe, so I considered myself to be quite lucky. I thought that day would be the same. (Omitted)”</p>

        <p>“&lt;Redacted&gt; closely observed the Abnormality. I just wanted to quickly write the observation report and get out of there, but he didn't feel the same way. He was sure of it; that there just couldn't be an Abnormality that doesn't have some special powers. I warned him not to get too close, but he took one step too far. And suddenly, the thing came to life, opened its lid, and swallowed him whole. And I mean it literally swallowed him. The lid closed and the machine started making a loud noise. There was no way to tell what was happening and I was too terrified to do anything. (Omitted)”</p>

        <p>“I realised that it was playing like an instrument. By crushing and cutting &lt;Redacted&gt;'s body, it was creating a melody. As I came to this horrific realisation, the lid opened again. Bits and pieces of &lt;Redacted&gt; were inside. So little that you had to wonder what happened to the rest of him. (Omitted)”</p>

        <p>&lt;MUST READ: Symptoms of Addiction to {abnoName}'s Music&gt;<br>
        1. Attempts to take other employees to {abnoName}'s containment unit through physical force.<br>
        2. Enlarged pupils.<br>
        3. Concentration of cognitive function are greatly reduced.<br>
        4. Will not listen to any other music.<br>
        Please list any additional symptoms that may be discovered and immediately report any cases of employees displaying the above syptoms.</p>

        <p>&lt;Excerpt from Incident Log&gt;<br>
        On X/X/XX, employee M-1840 was reported missing. 2 days later, remains of a body were found inside the {abnoName}. DNA analysis confirmed the corpse to be employee M-1840. They were a new hire who had worked in the company for only 3 months, and had no record of ever being assigned to the Abnormality. The main suspect was &lt;Redacted&gt;, who had been assigned to the {abnoName}. After an extensive investigation, &lt;Redacted&gt; confessed to the crime.</p>

        <p>“I know it sounds crazy, but I just had to hear that music again. It was stuck in my head for months. I tried all kinds of experiments. When I fed it a cat, it played for 1 minute. A large dog, 2 minutes 30 seconds. But nothing could compare to the music it makes when it eats a human. It might sound ridiculous, but I feel satisfied after having heard it once more.”</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the third Abnormality on the {Floor of Technology}, unlocking {Breakdown Music}, {Breakdown Rhythm}, and {Breakdown Musical Addiction} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} does not directly participate in combat, being non-targetable and not using any attacks. Instead 3 Addicted Employees are present in the fight, trying to subdue the librarian and feed them to the {abnoName}.</p>
      
      <p>The Addicted Employees initially use simple attacks, and may delibitate themsevles when losing clashes. On the third turn however, {abnoName} will open its lid and all Addicted Employees gain an extra action for that turn. They will each use '<span class="hardcover">I Pine for the Song!</span>' which will instantly put the target into the machine if it lands. They will each also use '<span class="hardcover">Hear this Beautiful Sound!</span>' which will Stagger the Addicted Employee if they are unable to do any damage with it. At the end of the turn, if an Addicted Employee is Staggered, and the machine is empty, they will be put into the machine.</p>

      <p>Only one person can be inside the {abnoName} at a time. When someone is put inside, they will suffer heavy damage and will be absent from the battle until the end of the next turn. While someone is inside, {abnoName} will play its music which will grant all librarians and employees 5 {LoR SE b Strength} while also changing their Stagger resistances to "Fatal".</p>

      <p>Once all 3 Addicted Employees have been defeated, the {abnoName} will be successfully suppressed.</p>
