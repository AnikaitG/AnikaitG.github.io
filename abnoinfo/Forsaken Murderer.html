      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> has the appearance of a near-bald man with pale skin. It is restrained in a tan straitjacket which covers the entirety of its body save for the head. Its face carries a blank expression, and it is often heard muttering to itself or breathing heavily. It is always seen sitting on its knees while hunched over. Even when moving around, it remains on its knees.</p>

      <p>When in an aggressive state, its head changes into a large blunt metal object which it uses as a hammer to crush opponents.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>An Abnormality that often screams profanities and insults, due to the excessive rage that plagues its brain. There is a wound on its forehead that never seems to heal. It hates everyone and everything. It wears a straitjacket, but it is as free as anyone, and no amount of chains or restraints will be enough to stop it from committing violence.</p>

        <p>He always had to wear a straitjacket. Some say he was a death row inmate from a federal prison. The researchers were always cautious around him. They felt that the straitjacket couldn't fully restrain him.<br>The researchers wanted to study a killer's brain to prove that innate evil existed. It was difficult to determine who was worse: A man who murdered the innocent, or the researchers who wanted to open up his brain to satiate their curiosity.</p>

        <p>A wide range of medicine and chemicals were injected. Some of them were used for the sake of humanity's future, while others were for new medical techniques. They all had the potential of changing the world. The researchers were excited. Though they didn't openly express it, it was almost palpable.<br>They said they found a cure. But only they knew what it cured. The prisoner spoke less and less. His aggressiveness was suppressed, but at the same time, he lost himself. After an extensive review, he was permitted to have the straitjacket removed.</p>

        <p>“It feels like my head is turning into metal. I can sometimes hear metallic creaks in my head…”<br>As the days passed by, he started inflicting self-harm. He would continuously bang his head against the wall or other hard surfaces. He insisted that someone check if his head was turning into metal.<br>One day they decided to leave him be in the hopes he would stop once he saw his own blood dripping from his self-inflicted wounds. However, even with blood pouring down his face, he did not stop until his wound was so deep that the whites of his skull were visible. He was made to wear a straitjacket again, but he was no longer feared or monitored like before.</p>

        <p>A researcher died. It would have been difficult to identify him were it not for his ID card, as his face had been caved in. The lax security meant that the door was often left unlocked or unattended. The prisoner that everyone believed to be confined began moving around on his knees.<br>“I feel… my head turning into metal… The grooves in my brain are being flattened…”<br>He kept repeatedly muttering strange words, and the final procedure was put in place. Treatment was halted, and his brain was dissected for research. How do I know this? I sedated him myself. He kept muttering nonense until the end.<br>“Ends…begins…ends…begins…ends…”</p>

      </div>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of Technology}, unlocking {Awakening Metallic Ringing}, {Breakdown Chained Wrath}, and {Breakdown Violence} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} employs a simple strategy where it uses '<span class="hardcover">Chained Wrath</span>' for 2 turns, building up {Light}, so it can use '<span class="hardcover">Metallic Ringing</span>' and overpower its opponent. The Power of the dice on '<span class="hardcover">Metallic Ringing</span>' are fairly high for how early the Abnormality is encountered, and it is unlikely the target will be able to match them. Additionally, its passive 'Wrath' makes it easier for {abnoName} to Stagger its target, allowing it to use '<span class="hardcover">Metallic Ringing</span>' the very next turn as well.</p>

      <p>Inflicting any sort of status effect onto {abnoName} activates its passive 'Fear'. This causes the Power of all its dice to drastically drop, allowing the Librarian to easily deal with its '<span class="hardcover">Metallic Ringing</span>'. The activation of 'Fear' is marked by {abnoName} breathing heavily.</p>
