      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> appears as a glob of red sap resting within a detached tree branch. It is described as belonging to a tree found living in the barren lands of the Outskirts.<br>
      The sap contains strong healing properties and will regenerate the health of anyone who drinks it. However, drinking the sap can occasionaly cause the consumer to rapidly melt into a green substance. The remains of the victims then serve as the tree's nutrition.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} is a Tool-type Abnormality and does not produce Enkephalin. An employee can drink the sap which will fully recover their HP and continue healing them for around a minute.<br>
      However, the sap can also cause the consumer to explode, killing them and dealing massive {WHITE} damage to everyone else in the room with them. The chance for this to occur increases as more sap is consumed.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Method</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Subjects who consume the {abnoName} instantly recover HP. Furthermore, they will continue to recover HP over time.</li>
        <li>A side effect was found from consuming the {abnoName}. Subjects who endured the side effect exploded and died within 20 to 30 seconds after consuming the {abnoName}, dealing {WHITE} damage to everyone in the same room.</li>
        <li>Experiments have confirmed that there is a positive relationship between the amount of {abnoName} consumed, the amount of HP recovered from the sap, and the probability of exploding.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Log</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The sap has been extracted from a gigantic, nameless tree rooted at the edge of the world.</li>
        <li>According to the exploration team, there were a large number of green-hued lifeforms around it. This was because the sap satiates them and contained potent healing properties.</li>
        <li>However, some employees who drank the sap melted, leaving smoldering green remains.</li>
        <li>Various other experiments have confirmed that the probability of the rapid melting increases as more sap is consumed.</li>
        <li>“Many wondered how such a large tree could prosper out on the barren Outskirts. The lifeforms that consumed its sap served as its nutrients. The tree reaped from what it sowed.”</li>
