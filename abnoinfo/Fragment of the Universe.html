    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> resembles a child's drawing and as a result has a rough, scribbly appearance with visible white gaps where colour has not been filled. It is black colour, possessing a spherical body supported by four long, thin appendages of irregular length. Three large hearts of different colours can be seen scribbled onto the front of its body. Its head is also in the shape of a heart and lacks eyes, a mouth or any other discernable facial feature.</p>

      <p>When hostile, its appearance changes. The hearts on its body become darker and partially obscured by the black scribbles. Its head also changes from a heart to an abtract shape with jagged edges. It has bloodshot eyes, one giant left eye, and two smaller right eyes. In the middle of the new head is a mouth lined with sharp teeth in a circular fashion.</p>

      <p>It primarily attacks opponents by impaling them with its tentacle-like limbs. It also occasionally 'sings'. Due to the otherworldly nature of the 'song', it can cause severe mental damage to anyone who hears it.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>The Abnormality resembles a child's scribbles. It initially didn't have a stable form. Even now its form is still changing, albeit at a very slow rate. Post anaylsis, it has been confirmed that it is of extraterrestrial origin. Its form is surreal; impossible to describe by word.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it speaks in a mysterious manner. One employee has previously attempted to decipher its speech (see Document 1, David's Song), but within days his sanity became corrupted. He suffered severe psychosis and had to be quarantined.</p>

        <p>The Abnormality's tentacles (they are not exactly tentacles, but we have to decided to call them that for convenience) have the ability to pierce through the barrier of reality. Employees impaled by the tentacles start suffering permanent brain damage.</p>

        <p>When the Abnormality escapes from its containment unit, it emits a noise in the corridor. Because this noise has a certain melody, it is considered to be "singing". Employees are never able to remember it precisely, and in most cases are unable to describe it due to their serious brain damage. Those who were within 100 metres of the singing called it a sound from out of this world. Thus, we have dubbed it as "Echoes from Beyond" (Refer to Document 2, The Song).</p>

        <p>&lt;Experiment 1 - Possibility of Communication&gt;<br>
        We have assessed that the Abnormality has an intelligence at the level of (or higher than) humans, and gave it a simple lanuage learning course. As a result, it can now communication crudely by stringing words together. The following is an excerpt from the communication log with the Abnormality.</p>

        <p>Q: Are your kind all similar in appearance?<br>A: Negative. Outside. Child. See. Picture. Face. Happy. Form. Change.</p>

        <p>Q: Why have you come here?<br>A: Knowledge. Share. Human.</p>

        <p>Q: Why do you want to share your knowledge with us?<br>A: Understanding. Knowledge. Moment. Know. Universe. Coincidence. Negative. None.</p>

        <p>The following is an attempt to decipher the communication.<br>
        1. It based its form on a child's drawing. It did so because the child had a happy expression while drawing the picture.<br>
        2. The Abnormality came here to share its knowledge with us. Once we fully understand its knowlege, we will know its ultimate goal.<br>
        3. There are no coincidences in the universe.</p>

        <p>&lt;Experiment 2 - Experiment on Laughter&gt;<br>
        After watcing a video about laughing for 30 minutes, the Abnormality recognised the concept of "laughter". Following this, when employees entered the containment unit, it would sometimes emit a strange noise as what appeared to be a smile formed on its face. It seemed that it was mimicking laughter.</p>

        <p>&lt;Experiment 3 - Understanding Symbols&gt;<br>
        Along with language, we taught it the meaning of various symbols. Among them was the symbol for a heart, which provoked a distinct change in the Abnormality.<br>Q: This is the symbol for the heart. Many people believe that emotions come from the heart, so this symbol is used to express positive emotions or a liking towards someone.<br>Afterwards, several symbols resembling hearts could be seen on the Abnormality's body. It seemed to understand that it could use the symbol to express friendliness towards humans.<br>From the results of this and the previous two experiments, it can be concluded that the Abnormality is non-hostile towards humans, and wishes to become friends.</p>

        <p>&lt;Document 1 - David's Song&gt;<br>
        David was known within the department for his attempts at communication with {abnoName}. He was an intellectual person, who enjoyed reading books on philosophy and star-gazing. Since he landed his position, he has been interested in {abnoName}, and researched its speech and behaviour purely out of personal interest.<br>And what became of him? He finally succeeded in entering {abnoName}'s domain. But his brain was unable to withstand it. He was transferred to the psychiatric ward, where he died from starvation while singing an unrecognisable song. This is why the Abnormality's voice must be kept confidential.<br>Audio Recording: Echoes from the Universe (Deleted)</p>

        <p>&lt;Document 2 - The Song&gt;<br>
        Why didn't tell me earlier that they'd gone mad because of that Abnormality? I can't tell if there's any pattern yet, but they all started behaving strangely on the exact same day. Can you imagine, three patients looking up towards the sky with strange expressions on their face, making strange wailing sounds in the corridor in the middle of the night while everyone else is asleep? I had a difficult time persuading the other patients that they must have been practicing for an upcoming Halloween event. Psychiatric treatment and medicine has proved to be ineffective. “Coming, coming, still coming” is what they're constantly saying. They've also spoken other words that don't exist in any known language. I don't think sending them to a general hospital was a wise decision.<br>- Urgent message from Doctor Alissa</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of Art}, unlocking {Awakening Echoes from Beyond}, {Awakening Tentacles}, and {Awakening Incomprehensible} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>{abnoName}'s strategy focuses on Staggering its target and it has a few utilities that aid it in this objective. Firstly, its passive 'Incomprehensible' means it deals twice the amount of Stagger damage from all of its attacks. Additionally, if it is able to land a hit with '<span class="hardcover">Penetrate</span>', it will add a copy of '<span class="hardcover">Enlightenment</span>' to the target's hand. While the target has '<span class="hardcover">Enlightenment</span>', their maximum Stagger will be halved.</p>
      
      <p>While having '<span class="hardcover">Enlightenment</span>' may seem like a negative, it also protects the Librarian from Fragment's '<span class="hardcover">Echoes from Beyond</span>' as it makes the attack deal 0 damage. It also provides a perfect block againt '<span class="hardcover">Penetrate</span>'.</p>
