      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is a plant-like creature with a thick serpentine body resembling a plant's stem. Several leaf-like spines are present on its body. The Abnormality possesses a red flower for a head, with a yellow centre resembling a nose, a pair of black eyes, and a pair of ear-like petals resembling those of a dog's.</p>
      <p>The tail is connected to a lightweight rubber ball covered in thorns. The thorns secrete a powder that induces pleasure into anyone that touches them. The pleasure received from the thorns is so great that it can cause the subject's blood to rush to their head, causing it to burst.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 1-5 {BLACK} damage and produces a maximum of 18 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Instinct} (High) > {Attachment} (Common) > {Insight} (Common) > {Repression} (Low).</p>

      <p>Employees with low {Temperance} are susceptible to being instantly killed by {abnoName} if they produce a {Good} work result, being easy prey to the Abnormality's pleasure-inducing thorns.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 2.<br>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} breaches containment. It will teleport to a random corridor in the facility where it will remain in a fixed position. {abnoName} is immune to ranged attacks, meaning employees have to be within its attacking range to deal damage to it. {abnoName} deals {WHITE} damage with its attacks, dealing increased damage to employees with low {Temperance}. When an employee panics due to the Abnormality's attacks, they will begin laughing until their head bursts from the pleasure.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>When the work result was {Good}, the Qliphoth Counter increased.</li>
        <li>When the work result was {Bad}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>When employees with {Temperance} Level 3 or below produced a {Good} work result, they were killed by the Abnormality.</li>
        <li>Employees with {Temperance} Level 3 or below receive massive {WHITE} damage from the Abnormality's attacks after it escapes.</li>
        <li>{abnoName} was not affected by an attack dealt to it from outside of its reach.</li>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>&lt;Time for the Head to Burst&gt;<br>To be frank, the daily life here isn't very fun. The company claims they promote healthy hobbies, but not many engage in that notion. Everyone has their own escape. Violence, gambling, eating… I thought I had a high level of self-control compared to others. And it helped me to live a smoother life. Maybe that's the reason why I was assigned to {abnoName}.</p>

        <p>Yes, about {abnoName}… Only the lowest of the low employees are assigned to work with it. I've heard about what other employees do its containment unit. They call it the "trust game". What an elegant thing to call it.</p>

        <p>(Omitted)</p>

        <p>The employees who worked with it in the past gave me some precautionary tips. They told me it wouldn't be difficult to become intimate with it, and once you do, you can easily get whatever you want from it. They said when the time comes, {abnoName} will lean down to provide easy access to its thorns. It didn't take long before it welcomed me and allowed me to pet it.</p>

        <p>(Omitted)</p>

        <p>When I first touched its thorns, I screamed because of how prickly they were. It felt like a giant needle had penetrated my skin. But I wasn't actually bleeding and the pain quickly subsided. Then, there it was. The most intense happiness you'll ever experience, it'll make your knees weak. When other employees came in to notify me that my shift had ended, they found me drooling.</p>

        <p>The pleasure felt so unfamiliar that I didn't go back for a while. But that just made things worse. You start to suffer from withdrawal symptons, like puking or sweating. It's different for every employee. One employee even pulled out all their teeth because they felt like there were small bugs crawling all over them.</p>

        <p>The feeling? There's aren't any words to describe it. Can you remember the happiest moment of your life? This feeling would be thousands of times better than that.</p>

        <p>I'm that last living employee that was assigned to {abnoName}? That's understandable, seeing as how the brain demands stronger stimulations. At first, all I had to do lightly prick myself with one of the thorns. Now, I have to scrub my whole body with the thorns to get the same high. I feel like all the blood in my body will rush to my head, eventually causing it to burst. I've already imagined my head bursting over thousands of times.</p>

        <p>I've gotta go now, it's time for work again. Actually, I'm drenched with sweat now, did you notice?</p>

        <p>By the way, one more thing to mention. It's not what you think, {abnoName} isn't aggressive at all. It's never tried to eat us or bite our heads off. You mentioned that all the corpses were smiling happily, didn't you? That's all it is. It makes people smile till their death.</p>

        <p>There's no need for any blame. We're living in hell every day… It's just a small taste of heaven.</p>

        <p>You know what? I feel sorry for you. You've never felt these feelings and you never will. Instead you have to interview an addicted employee like me while pretending to be decent.</p>

        <p>Now it's time for my head to burst. Good day.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the third Abnormality on the {Floor of Art}, unlocking {Awakening Thorns}, {Breakdown Elation}, and {Breakdown Laughing Powder} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>All of {abnoName}' attacks add copies of '<span class="hardcover">Pleasure</span>' to the target's hands. While '<span class="hardcover">Pleasure</span>' boosts the holder's {Light} generation, it leaves them susceptible to a powerful attack from {abnoName} if it hits them while they have 3 or more copies of it.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} also possesses high-rolling evade dice, that allow it to dodge the majority of its opponents attacks leaving them defenseless againsts its own attacks which add '<span class="hardcover">Pleasure</span>'.</p>
      
      <p>'<span class="hardcover">Pleasure</span>' also provides a reliable way to damage {abnoName} through its abundance of evades, especially since the Abnormality is immune to the more powerful ranged attacks.</p>
