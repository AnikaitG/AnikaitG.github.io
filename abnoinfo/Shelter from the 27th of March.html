    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> appears as a bunker that shuts off all contact with the outside world, not even allowing in light causing the interior to be completely dark. The bunker is relativelt barren save for some supporting pillars, and a collection of crates which are each emblazoned with the logo for P Corp. The crates apparently contain enough supplies to allow inhabitants to survive inside the bunker for an extremely long time.<br>
      The bunker is capable of manipulating its surroundings, and when it has an occupant, it is able to change the state of the outside to be even more dangerous. Hence, making itself even safer in comparison.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} is a Tool-type Abnormality and does not produce Enkephalin. An employee can enter the shelter and will remain inside until ordered to leave. While inside, they will become safe to almost any source of damage, and will continously heal HP and SP. No other entity will be able to enter the shelter while the employee is inside.<br>
      However, for every 30 seconds the employee remains inside, the Qliphoth Counter of a random Abnormality will fall to 0.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Method</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The subject who enters the {abnoName} will be immune to all forms of damage. (This does not apply to damage caused by <a href="profile.html?abno=Portrait of Another World">O-09-91</a>). Furthermore, their HP and SP will slowly regenerate from the moment they enter the {abnoName}.</li>
        <li>If a subject enters the {abnoName} while being pursued, they will become undetectable to their pursuer.</li>
        <li>If a subject remains inside the {abnoName} for 30 seconds or more, the Qliphoth Counter of a random Abnormality in the facility will drop to 0. This phenomenon will repeatedly occur to other containment units until the subject leaves the {abnoName}.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Log</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A shelter that fully protects its interior from anything from the outside world, including light.</li>
        <li>The shelter still retains memories of that day.</li>
        <li>P Corp. wished to build the safest place on Earth. As such, the interior housed a large amount of long-lasting supplies which would allow anyone who stayed inside to survive for an extremely long period of time.</li>
        <li>Thanks to the shelter, the selected refugees were shielded from the flood of screams and bloodshed.</li>
        <li>But the shelter, while perfectly safe inside, alters the state of the outside to become even more hopeless. It literally becomes "the safest place on Earth."</li>
      </ul>
