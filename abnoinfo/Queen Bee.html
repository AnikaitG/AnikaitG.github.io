    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is a combination of a bee hive and the queen bee. It has large yellow body with black stripes segmented into four tiers. A cross-section of the insides are visible at the base of each tier, showing that the Abnormality is pieced together by several pieces of cut meat. It lacks limbs and as a result is incapable of movement. It has two sets of tattered insect wings, but it is incapable of flight.<br>
      The head is horrible disfigured, giving it three mouths, with sharp teeth present in the gaps. It possesses a pair of crumpled antennae and a single blue eye.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} is capable of producing a cloud of spores which contain eggs for its drones. When an individual inhales the spores, the egg will hatch and the larva feeds on the host from the inside. Once the larva grows too big, it bursts out from the host's neck, severing their head from the body.</p>

      <p>The drones, or Worker Bees, are taller than a human. Unlike their queen, they possess three sets of legs as well as a pair of arms, and are capable of movement. Its head lacks eyes and has an exposed jaw lined with large, sharp teeth that it uses to smash the head of its targets. The Worker Bees are loyal to {abnoName} and will harvest flesh to help the queen grow for the prosperity of their kingdom.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 4-6 {RED} damage and produces a maximum of 22 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Insight} (High) > {Instinct} (Common) > {Attachment} (Common) > {Repression} (Very Low).<br>
      The work success rate is Very Low for low level employees, regardless of the work order.</p>

      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 1.<br>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} will produce a cloud of spores that will infect random employees that are within the department where it is contained. Employees who have inhaled the spores will receive continous bursts of {RED} damage, have reduced movement speed, and will be incapable of regenerating HP.</p>

      <p>When an employee dies to the spores, a Worker Bee will be born from their corpse. Worker Bees will roam around the facility, attacking any employees they come across. If an employee is killed by a Worker Bee, another Worker Bee will emerge from their corpse. The Worker Bees need to be eliminated quickly in order to prevent a large scale infestation.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>When the work result was {Normal}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased with a normal probability.</li>
        <li>When the work result was {Bad}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased with a high probability.</li>
        <li>When the Qliphoth Counter reached 0, {abnoName} emitted spores throughout the entire department.</li>
        <li>The spores attached to employees for a certain amount of time, inflicting {RED} damage to the victim. In addition, the spore-infested employees had reduced movement speed and could not be healed by the regenerator or HP bullets.</li>
        <li>When the HP of an spore-infested employee had depleted, a giant drone bursted out from their body which proceeded to attack nearby employees. From the corpses of the employees killed by the drones, more drones emerged.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>This Abnormality takes the form of a huge bee hive merged with a bee. The exposed cross-sections reveal dark red particles that look like sliced meat. Its face is severely distorted. There are wings, but they do not function. One of the eyes appears relatively intact, and its pupil continously scans for intruders. The Abnormality always sits still, so it assumed that it cannot move.</p>

        <p>When certain conditions have been met, it releases a cloud of spores around it. It is capable of generating billions of spores in a 20-metre radius. The existence of lifeforms in the vicinity seems to be one of the key requirements for this to occur.</p>

        <p>No immediate change was found in an employee that had inhaled the spores, and several tests failed to detect any notable symptoms.<br>
        After some time, the employee in question began to suffer from severe pain in the occipital lobe and the abdomen. Some time later, the employee's head detached from their body, and a Worker Bee emerged from within.</p>

        <p>It has been confirmed that the spores carry drone eggs, which hatch inside of a living host. Based on the findings from an autopsy report, we believe that the larva preys on anything from blood, organs, or fat, and freely moves around within the body. When it becomes too large to move, it creates a cocoon near the intestines. At this stage, the host will experience increased hunger and consume more food than usual. As the cocoon grows, it moves upwards, finally damaging the artery and cricothyroid with its jaws as it severs its host's head from the body. The drone then emerges from the body by expanding the wound of the host.</p>

        <p>&lt;Counselling Log&gt;<br>
        &lt;Redacted&gt; had been complaining about a ticking sensation in his neck for quite some time. I also saw him taking several digestives… Who would have thought that would signal such a serious issue? I could never have imagined that I would witness such a horrible moment.<br>(Omitted)<br>
        We were just chatting, but then he suddenly stopped talking. He was still scratching his neck. It had become so red that I was worried he might have had an infection or something. Then he began to twist his neck at a strange angle. That was when I realised the severity of the situation. He could not have been twisting his neck that way on his own. It looked like something else was forcefully twisting his neck instead.</p>

        <p>And then I heard the sound of something tearing, like the sound you might hear when tearing paper, and his head just popped off. It fell to the ground with a damp plop.<br>
        Then something came out of his neck; like how a butterfly emerges from its cocoon. Those wings, its yellow body, its teeth… A monster I never want to see again. (Omitted)<br>
        It had no eyes, but it seemed to be aware of me. But instead of attacking me, it picked up &lt;Redacted&gt;'s head and started for the containment unit, like a drone carrying honey…<br>
        Sometimes I still hear the sound of its jaws rattling, and its wings fluttering.</p>

        <p>&lt;Worker Bee&gt;<br>
        Thought to be a member of the same species as the {abnoName}, its form is very different from the queen aside from colour. It has eight legs and limited flying capabilities that only allow it to hover approximately 1 hour above the ground. The head, thorax, and abdomen can be easily distinguished. Unlike the queen, it does not have eyes or antennae. Something resembling an intestine drags behind at the end of its tail.<br>
        They only show two types of behaviour: Delivering nutrients to the queen, or proliferating. When encountering an employee, it attacks the head with its jaws, smashing it and inserting a larva into the victim.</p>

      <h3 class="profile-header">Library of Ruina</h3>
      <hr class="header-seperator">

      <div class="page-img-container">
        <a class="display-img" href="../images/abnos/Queen Bee/LoR Idle.png" data-lightbox="LoRIdle" data-title="Idle"><img class="page-img" src="../images/abnos/Queen Bee/LoR Idle.png"/></a>
          <div class="caption">{abnoName} in Library of Ruina</div>
      </div>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the fourth Abnormality on the {Floor of History}, unlocking {Awakening Spores}, {Breakdown Worker Bee}, and {Breakdown Loyalty} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} is joined by four Worker Bees. It does not have any offensive attacks itself, and relies on its drones to fight off its opponents. All damage types are Ineffective against {abnoName} and it exclusively uses Block Dice, making it difficult to directly confront it. Additionally, it punishes attackers by inflicting {LoR SE d Spores} to those unable to break its guard, and to all opponents the following turn.</p>

      <p>The {LoR SE d Spores} inflicted by the Abnormality can be extremely dangerous as they constant chip away at the inflicted's health. Whenever a librarian dies while infested with {LoR SE d Spores}, a new Worker Bee spawns from their corpse (though only four Worker Bees can be present at a time).</p>
      
      <p>The Worker Bees will always target the opponent that last attacked {abnoName}. They are capable of inflicting {LoR SE d Spores} themselves and can deal additional damage based on the amount of {LoR SE d Spores} the target is inflicted with. Using '<span class="paperback">Procure Nutrients</span>', they can even restore {abnoName}'s HP. Eliminating all Worker Bees will leave {abnoName} with no way to attack, but doing so will also cause it to increase its production of {LoR SE d Spores}.</p>

      <p>Every 3 turns, {abnoName} will use pages to boost the aggression and loyalty of its drones. If it is not Staggered by the end of the turn, it will give its allies considerable buffs. However, when in this state, all of its Stagger resistances will change to "Fatal" making it vulnerable. When {abnoName}'s HP falls to 20% or less, all Worker Bees will target it with '<span class="limited">Embrace of Death</span>'. This will almost assuredly eliminate the Queen, leading to a successful suppression.</p>
