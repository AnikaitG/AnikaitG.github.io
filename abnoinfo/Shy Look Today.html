    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is a humanoid entity lacking arms and wearing a burgundy coloured dress. The dress covers the entirety of its body, including the head, save for the lower legs and feet. The entity also lacks skin, apparent from the state of its feet, and the blood pooling around them.</p>

      <p>The Abnormality hides behind a bloodied, metal clothesline with its skin stretched across it, obscuring the upper half of the humanoid's body. Five faces have been cut into the skin, each representing a different mood and expression. From left to right there is a happy face with a beaming grin, one with a simple smile, one with a blank expression, one that is frowning, and finally an angry, scowling face.</p>

      <p>Each face has eyeholes cut out for Shy Look to peek through. It rapidly shifts behind the skin, selecting an expression at random.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 2-3 {BLACK} damage and produces a maximum of 12 {E-Boxes}.<br>It responds to all four work orders eqaully:<br>{Instinct} (Common) = {Insight} (Common) = {Attachment} (Common) = {Repression} (Common).<br>It perfers work performed by lower level agents.</p>

      <p>When no employee is performing work on it, {abnoName} will continuously shift between its different faces at random. Once an employee enters the containment unit, Shy Look will stop at whatever face it was behind when they entered, and only resume changing once the work is complete and the employee leaves. While Shy Look shows no preference in Work Orders, the actual work success rate depends on which facial expression it has during the work. The success rate for its faces are as follows:<br>Happy (Very High) > Smiling (High) > Neutral (Common) > Sad (Low) > Angry (Very Low)</p>

      <p>Additionally, {abnoName} deals less damage and heals the employee when it is Happy or Smiling, and deals increased damage when Sad or Angry.</p>
      
      <p>It does not have a Qliphoth Counter, and does not breach containment.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The Abnormality changes its facial expression at random intervals. However, while face to face with an employee, it stops changing.</li>
        <li>From smiling to anger, it has five levels of facial expressions referred to as Faces 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.</li>
        <li>Face 3 showed no special features. Face 2 showed an increase in the work success rate, and the employee recovered SP every time a PE-Box was produced.</li>
        <li>When work was performed with Face 4, the damage dealt to the employee increased by 1.5x and the work success rate decreased.</li>
        <li>When work was performed with Face 5, the damage dealt to the employee was doubled and the work success rate drastically decreased.</li>
        <li>When work was performed with Face 1, the damage dealt to the employee was halved and the work success rate increased. Additionally, the employee recovered both HP and SP every time a PE-Box was produced.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>Good day today! Are you still shy today?</p>

        <p>One sunny day, when she was carefully drying her laundry in the yard, sadness suddenly overcame her.</p>
          
        <p>“We must hold sacrifices for the sake of the City in high regard. There's no reason for you to cry. Rather, you should be rejoicing.”</p>
        
        <p>“What's with that look on your face? That kind of expression doesn't belong in the City.”</p>

        <p>“My goodness, why are you maiking that face? You'll make others feel gloomy as well. Please be more considerate. You don't live in this world alone.”</p>

        <p>“You're not very good at expressing your feelings. You must be shy.”</p>

        <p>“You should look more pleased. That way, those who are living in the Outskirts will be more envious of us.”</p>

        <p>“Come on, put a bigger smile on your face! It's not that hard!”</p>

        <p>“You need to express yourself more clearly. Self-expression is very important in the City.”</p>

        <p>One sunny day, just as she had so delicately dried her laundry before, she dried her own skin.<br>She smiled broadly to satisfy everyone. If people ask her what's wrong, she responds by simply saying, “I'm just shy, that's all. Just shy…”</p>

        <p>Don't try to peek at her real face that hides behind the skin. The result won't be pretty. The space behind her skin is the only personal space she has left. Leaving it uninvaded is the last generosity the City can offer.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of Literature}, unlocking {Breakdown Look of the Day}, {Awakening Personal Space}, and {Awakening Shyness} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} appears in combat without its clothesline, though it wears a skin mask similar carrying the same expressions to hide its face. At the start of the turn, Shy Look's mask will shift between the 5 different expressions at random.</p>

      <p>During combat, the mask will stick to whatever expression it was wearing when the combat started. This face will determine the actual range for Shy Look's dice, with Angry rolling the highest and Happy rolling the lowest.</p>
      
      <p>The ranges are as follows:<br>Happy: 2, Smiling: 2-9, Neutral: 9, Sad: 9-16, Angry: 16</p>
