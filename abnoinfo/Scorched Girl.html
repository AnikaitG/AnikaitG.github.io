      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> has the appearance of a young girl that has been charred beyond recognition. Its entire body, including its hair and pigtails, have a blackened, burnt appearance. Its legs are short and thin and it lacks arms.</p>
      <p>A large matchstick is impaled through its torso. The matchstick is perpetually lit and appears to never extinguish.</p>
      <p>{abnoName} is capable of self-destructing. It typically picks a target and heads toward them, ignoring any one else in its path. It is usually heard sobbing during this process. Once it reaches its target, it explodes in a fiery blast killing the target as well as anyone else in the vicinity.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>An Abnormality in the form of a burnt girl. Even though there's nothing left to burn, the fire engulfing her does not extinguish.</p>

        <p>A matchstick has impaled the girl's body like a stake. The match is always lit, while the Abnormality shows no signs of distress or activity. Because of this, some employees speculate that the actual Abnormality is the match and not the girl. However, there have recently been reports of the scorched girl weeping.</p>

        <p>&lt;Excerpt from Abnormality Specialist, Doctor &lt;Redacted&gt;'s Research Log&gt;<br>
        “The charred body signifies the child's crumbled hope, while the perpetual flame represents her desire for affection. She is in a constant conflict between the two.”<br>
        “Damn, we paid a boatload just for this rubbish?”</p>

        <p>&lt;Excerpt from Recorded Employee Conversation&gt;<br>
        “She's like a ticking time bomb. It's impossible to tell if she's in a good mood or not. All we can do is hope that it won't be us before entering the containment unit. She won't get better. We can only stop her from getting worse.”</p>

        <p>&lt;Employee M-3923 Counselling Log&gt;<br>
        “I never thought the Abnormality would be able to escape. Maybe we were getting careless, but it seemed that all it could do was just burn up the match in its body. Yes, our response was a bit late. (Omitted) Most Abnormalities that try to escape would attack the employees in front of them. But this one didn't show any aggression toward the nearby employees. Instead, it headed to a different department, which happens to be the most crowded place in the company. If we hadn't suppressed it at the door, half the people here wouldn't be alive today.”</p>

        <div class="caption">{abnoName} in Library of Ruina</div>
      </div>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of History}, unlocking {Awakening Ashes}, {Breakdown Footfalls}, and {Breakdown Matchlight} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} is accompanied by two Last Match Flames which appear as burnt out matchsticks with stick-like arms and legs. The Last Match Flames are the main enemies during the battle, inflicting {LoR SE d Burn} as well as evading attacks to stall out turns while {abnoName} builds up {Light}.</p>
      
      <p>After {abnoName} fully builds up {Light}, it uses the skill '<span class="hardcover">Fourth Match Flame</span>', approaching the target and exploding causing an instant death in most cases. This attack deals no damage to {abnoName} and, in the event the battle continues, it returns to building up {Light}.</p>

      <p>Every time a Last Match Flame is deafeated, {abnoName} loses all it's {Light}, half its health and gets Staggered. Defeating both matches leads to the Abnormality's suppresion.</p>
