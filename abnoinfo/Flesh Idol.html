      <p>{abnoName} is a Tool-type Abnormality and does not produce Enkephalin. An employee can be ordered to enter the containment unit to pray to it, and will continue to do so until they are either told to stop, or are killed. During the prayer, {abnoName} will deal 7 damage of a random type: {RED}, {WHITE}, {BLACK} or {PALE}.<br>
      After 20 seconds of continuous prayer, {abnoName} will heal the HP of all employees in the facility except for the worshipper. After 45 seconds, it will begin to also heal SP.<br>
      If the worshipper prays for 20 seconds or less, they die. The worshipper will also die if they prey continuously for over 90 seconds, however this will also set the Qliphoth Counter for every Abnormality in the facility to 0.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Method</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>{abnoName}'s effects manifest via prayer. The subject praying to {abnoName} will receive damage of a random type throughout the prayer.</li>
        <li>&lt;Experiment 1&gt; The subject ended their prayer within 20 seconds. The subject died.</li>
        <li>&lt;Experiment 2&gt; The subject prayed for a duration between 21 to 45 seconds. During this timeframe, all employees other than the subject recovered HP over time.</li>
        <li>&lt;Experiment 3&gt; The subject prayed for a duration between 46 to 90 seconds. Results were similar to Experiment 2, but employees other than the subject also recovered SP.</li>
        <li>&lt;Experiment 4&gt; The subject prayed for longer than 90 seconds. The subject died, and the Qliphoth Counters for all Abnormalities dropped to 0.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Log</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A lump of flesh meshed with pieces of scrap metal, affixed to a metal cross.</li>
        <li>It is speculated to be a religious artifact, and was found within a flooded area. In the past, some people sought answers through religion. When an employee offers a prayer, the flesh begins to move, as if responding to the prayer.</li>
        <li>The worshipper will suffer through various ordeals, as if their devotion was being trialed. But others around them will recover both physically and mentally, as if being blessed with redemption.</li>
        <li>And the prayer always ends with the eternal despair of the worshipper.</li>
      </ul>
