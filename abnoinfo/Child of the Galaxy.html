    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is a young boy with skin that resembles a starry night sky, and a galaxy visible in its hair. It wears a black tank top and grey pants that are torn at the bottom, with a hole in the left pant leg.</p>

      <p>The child has big blue eyes that usually carry a tearful look. The Abnormality has a fairly shy demeanor, but displays a great interest in forming bonds with others. When {abnoName} considers a person as its friend, it will gift them a white, glowing pebble as a token of their friendship.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} is extremely protective of its friends. It becomes jealous whenever one of their friends spend time with someone else, paranoid that they are being replaced and that the friend will leave them. The pebble allows the child to spy on the friend, keeping track of their movements and actions, and to also whisper to them.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 2-3 {BLACK} damage and produces a maximum of 16 {E-Boxes}.<br>It responds to all four work orders equally:<br>{Instinct} (Common) = {Insight} (Common) = {Attachment} (Common) = {Repression} (Common).</p>

      <p>When an employee first finishes a work with {abnoName}, they will receive a pebble from the Abnormality for that day. The pebble will continously heal the employee's health and sanity, the amount scaling in proportion to the Qliphoth Counter.<br>
      When an employee who is in possession of a pebble finishes a work with {abnoName}, it will increase the Qliphoth Counter, further boosting the healing effects of the pebble.<br>
      If the employee works with a different Abnormality, they will instead receive damage from the pebble during the work. This damage also scales proportionally to {abnoName}'s Qliphoth Counter. Once the work is finished, the child's Qliphoth Counter will decrease.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 1, but can be increased to a maximum of 5. Upon reaching 0, all employees holding a pebble will instantly die and {abnoName} will fall to is knees and begin crying loudly.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>When an employee finished the work, they received a Token of Friendship. This constantly healed the employee's HP and SP relative to {abnoName}'s Qliphoth Counter.</li>
        <li>When an employee with a Token of Friendship finished the work, the Qliphoth Counter increased.</li>
        <li>When an employee with a Token of Friendship worked with another Abnormality, they received damage relative to {abnoName}'s Qliphoth Counter, which then decreased.</li>
        <li>When an employee with a Token of Friendship died, the Qliphoth Counter decreased by 4.</li>
        <li>When the Qliphoth Counter reached 0, all employees with a Token of Friendship died.</li>

      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>“It was the middle of the night when fog gracefully covered the world.<br>
        A child with bare feet was gazing at me without a word.<br>
        I paused, as I saw the sadness hanging on his face.<br>
        He was crying, his dreamy eyes filled with sorrow and grace.<br>
        I offered to lend him my help.<br>
        He smiled, as his sorrow did melt.<br>
        The child's tear dropped, as a star fell from the sky.<br>
        The world fell into a sleep, trapped in ecstatic lullaby.<br>
        The night, when the galaxy descended upon bare feet.”<br>
        - Excerpt from the diary of employee &lt;Redacted&gt;, prior to their suicide
        </p>

        <p>A boy with big eyes, and skin that resembles the starry night sky. It is fairly shy, but doesn't show any fear or hostility towards others. It becomes very friendly after forming a certain level of friendship with someone. Some employees have a purely favourable impression of this Abnormality.</p>

        <p>It largely favours conversing and playing with others, showing a strong attachment to the act of making contact with others.</p>

        <p>If the boy reaches a certain level of intimacy with an employee, it will gift a small pebble to its friend. While holding the pebble, the employee feels happiness and vigor. However, the effects will be different if the employee enters any containment unit other than its.</p>

        <p>If an employee with the pebble, a token of the child's friendship, dies, the Abnormality shows deep grief for their death.</p>

        <p>&lt;Diary of Employee &lt;Redacted&gt;&gt;<br>
        X/X/XX<br>I looked into his eyes for a long time. I space out for a while because his eyes were just so dreamy. I wanted to pat his head, but my colleagues told me not to hold personal feelings towards the Abnormalities.<br>
        X/X/XX<br>I told him my name. His eyes grew wide and he repeated it multiple times, as if he had just learned a huge secret. When he called my name, it felt like it had become something more than just a familar thing I had been living with.<br>
        X/X/XX<br>When someone else entered his chamber, he didn't talk to them and just looked around for me. I felt strangely triumphant after hearing about that. He likes me, not you.<br>
        X/X/XX<br>The moment I entered the boy's room, he jumped into my arms while crying. I had to keep reassuring him that I would visit him regularly from now on. When I finally managed to set him down after a bit of struggling, a small, white pebble dropped into my hands. “Please don't lose it. And don't give it to anyone else either.” the boy mumbled.<br>
        X/X/XX<br>“Do you like that bird more than me?” The boy quietly asked me this after I had finished a work with <a href="profile.html?abno=Big Bird">Big Bird</a>. I asked him how he found out what I was doing. “I know. I know everything about you. Whatever you do, wherever you go.” His gaze fell down to the pebble, and he smiled. His eyes gave me goosebumps.<br>
        X/X/XX<br>I tried to throw away the pebble, but for some reason I wasn't able to. I don't even understand what's going on anymore… “You still love me, don't you?” The boy smiled at me. He smiled, smiled, smiled, smiled…<br>
        X/X/XX<br>I can't get this pebble off of my body. My only hope now is that someday the boy will get tired of me. I'm waiting for that day… but will it ever come? People keep telling me I'm an excellent employee. You idiots don't know anthing, shut up.<br>
        Final Entry<br>I can't take it anymore. I can't escape from him. I thought I was in charge but the truth is that I was just a plaything in the boy's hands all along. Whatever I do, wherever I go, I hear him whispering. I don't even know if I can end it or not.<br>
        “I came from afar. I'm so glad that I met you. Become a pebble, and walk the galaxy with me…” I hear his whispers and his breath. What follows is a pitch black darkness. Just like the night when I first met him.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the second Abnormality on the {Floor of Art}, unlocking {Breakdown Teardrop}, {Awakening Token of Friendship}, and {Breakdown Pebble} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} is joined by two Friends to the Galaxy. The child does not directly participate in combat, with the Friends fighting in its stead.<br>
      The Friends cannot be killed, and can only be brought down to 1 HP. In order to complete the suppresion, both of the Friends need to be brought down to 1 HP together. If only one of them is brought to this point, it will become Staggered. If the second friend is not dealt lethal damage within two turns of this, the Friend at 1 HP will recover HP equal to its ally.</p>
      
      <p>At the start of each turn, both Friends will heal 10% of their HP making it more difficult to bring them both down to 1 HP. Though while a Friend is at 1 HP, it will no longer heal HP for two turns allowing the other Friend to be focused down.<br>
      While a Friend is in this state, {abnoName} will become distressed, falling to is knees and crying. This signifies the activation of the 'Parting Tears' passive which makes all characters (including the Friend) lose 10% of their Max HP.</p>
