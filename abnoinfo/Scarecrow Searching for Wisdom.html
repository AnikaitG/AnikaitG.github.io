      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is a straw scarecrow wearing a red plaid shirt with white stripes, and blue overalls. Its torso is exposed, revealing blood-stained straw with entrails sticking out. It also wears a big orange bowtie with polka dots. It has two hollowed eyes and a smile stitched onto its face. The top of its head is open and empty, though it is usually obscured by its rope hat.</p>

      <p>Its left hand is a metal hoe while its right hand is a metal rake. It uses these instruments to cut open the top of its victims' heads to gain access to their brains. Upon doing so, a long straw extends from an opening in its mouth to suck out the victim's brain to absorb their knowledge and wisdom.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 2-6 {WHITE} damage and produces a maximum of 18 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Insight} (Very High) > {Instinct} (Common) = {Attachment} (Common) = {Repression} (Common).</p>

      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 1.<br>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} breaches containment. It will roam around the facility, attacking employees with its metal hoe and rake dealing {BLACK} damage. After killing an employee, it will extend a straw from its mouth to suck out their brain, recovering HP in the process. Once the brain has been completely drained, Scarecrow will resume attacking other targets.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>When an employee with {Prudence} Level 3 or above finished the work, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>When the work result was {Bad}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>When the Abnormality killed an employee after escaping, it sucked out their brain to recover its HP.</li>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>An Abnormality that takes the form of a straw scarecrow. Its straw is stained with blood.</p>

        <p>The head is empty, as if someone forcefully tore it out. It shows aggression towards certain employees by attempting to take their brains. These employees are ones that scored "Excellent" on the IQ test.</p>

        <p>Each city required its own technology. That was the key to reviving the city. There were numerous technologies, but among them there was one city that possessed the technology for advanced body replacement. It could fix, change, or replace a failing or unwanted body part. Every citizen of the city was eligible to receive the treatment. But there was a rumour. If there was a poor person with failing lungs and a rich person who wished for better eyesight, then they would remove the eyes of the poor and give them to the rich. The corpse of the poor person would be discarded in the Outskirts and left to rot.</p>

        <p>The city's spokesperson reassured the citizens, dismissing the rumours as false. To put the rumours to rest, he announced that a few selected sick people from the Outskirts would have any body part that they desired fixed. Of the lucky few that were chosen, one finally returned several days later. There was a long scar visible on his forehead. People asked him how he felt and he responded that his head felt lighter. He was a sad man who used to cry a lot, so everyone believed that the surgery had been a success.</p>

        <p>However, when he was asked about the whereabouts of the others who were selected, he just smiled without a word. Even later, on the day of his parents' funeral, he showed no emotion. After receiving the treatment, all he did was stare out the window and talk to himself. Eventually, he hung himself on the the doorknob of his house. Some people believed that the treatment was the cause of all his troubles, but after a few days he was completely forgotten. The city still remained beautiful and the emerald roads sparkled brighter than ever.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of Social Sciences}, unlocking {Breakdown Torn Off Wisdom}, {Awakening Gleaning}, and {Awakening Rake} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, there are three Scarecrows present. Each Scarecrow follows the same attack pattern but offset. This means that each turn, one of the Scarecrows will gain an additional Speed Die and use 2 copies of '<span class="limited"> Harvest Wisdom</span>'. This attack allows the Scarecrow to heal its HP and steal pages from the target's hand. If it is able to absorb any pages, it will receive buffs the following turn proportional to the number of pages it absorbed.</p>
      
      <p>'<span class="limited">Wisdom</span>' provides a guaranteed win against '<span class="limited">Harvest Wisdom</span>', and will also debuff the Scarecrow and deal extra Stagger damage. However, each librarian only starts with 1 copy of '<span class="limited">Wisdom</span>' in their hand and additional copies can only be obtained by blocking or evading the other Scarecrows' attacks. Thus, they must be used judiciously.<br>
      To allow librarians to clash with '<span class="limited">Harvest Wisdom</span>', the Scarecrow using the attack will be inflcited with 5 {LoR SE d Bind} for the turn it uses said attack.</p>

      <p>If the Scarecrows are able to absorb all the pages from a librarian, leaving them with an empty deck, they will become Staggered at the start of each turn.</p>
