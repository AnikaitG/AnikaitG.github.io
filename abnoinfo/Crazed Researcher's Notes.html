      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> appears as a notepad filled with the research of a mad researcher. The contents of the notes contain confessions of unethical experimentation, expressing the researcher's guilt. However, the notes eventually descend into crazed scribblings.<br>
      When someone holds the notebook, they are imbued with rsearch skills. Attempting to return them without fulfilling the desire for knowledge can cause the holder to explode.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} is a Tool-type Abnormality and does not produce Enkephalin. An employee can borrow the notepad to boost their {Temperance}, increasing their work success rate and work speed.<br>
      If the employee is ordered to return the notepad without working on an non-Tool Abnormality, or within 30 seconds of equipping it, they will explode on the spot. Additionally, if the employee receives enough HP or SP damage while holding the notes, they will also explode and deal a large amount of {RED} damage to everyone else in the room.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Method</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Subjects who equip the {abnoName} will benefit from a sharp increase in stats relating to {Temperance}.</li>
        <li>If ordered to return the {abnoName} within 30 seconds of equipping it, the holder's skin will start to swell and their body will explode within seconds.</li>
        <li>If ordered to return the {abnoName} without performing any managerial work, the holder will explode.</li>
        <li>If the holder receives a certain amount of HP or SP damage, they will explode. The explosion will cover the entire room, dealing massive {RED} to all nearby.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Log</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The old notes are full of incomprehensible cursive writing.</li>
        <li>They once belonged to a researcher who had gone mad during their work. It has only been partially deciphered, but it seems most of it relates to the various experiments that were conducted in this place.</li>
        <li>It begins with guilt and confessions of unethical experimentation, but ends with crazy and broken up sentences about the research.</li>
        <li>The final chapter ends with the phrase, “Born again.”</li>
        <li>An employee's observational skills will improve just by holding the item. But if it is returned without fulfilling its desire for knowledge, the incompetent employee will explode.</li>
      </ul>
