      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is an extremely large entity bearing a blue, heart-shaped star as a core. It possesses innumerous grey legs which sprout out haphazardly from its centre. The Abnormality is usually seen levitating, and is capable of teleportation.</p>

      <p>{abnoName}'s 'heart' emits a glowing blue light, while its centre is a pitch black void. This hole acts as a vacuum, sucking in targets and killing them.</p>

      <p>The Abnormality often invokes feelings of devotion and idolization in its targets, causing them to worship it. Worshippers of the {abnoName} express a desire to willingly throw themselves into the Abnormality's centre, claiming they must "return to that place" to cleanse themselves of their sins. {abnoName} is also capable of producing a low-pitched hum which encourages targets to respond to the 'call' and act as 'martyrs', being sucked into the Abnormality to be reborn as stars.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 6-9 {WHITE} damage and produces a maximum of 33 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Insight} (Common) > {Repression} (Common) > {Instinct} (Low) > {Attachment} (Very Low).</p>

      <p>If an employee with low {Temperance} enters its containment unit, or when an employee spends too much time in the containment unit for a work order, they will get on their knees to worship {abnoName} as it sucks them inside.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 2.<br>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} breaches containment, teleporting into the main room of a random department. After teleporting, it remains stationary floating in the air, immediately sucking in employees with low {Temperance} or {Prudence}. It occasionally lets out bursts of {WHITE} damage that affect every employee in the facility. Any employee that falls into a panic from its attacks becomes a worshipper and immediately gets sucked into its centre, dying.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Employees with {Temperance} Level 3 or below were immediately sucked into the centre of the Abnormality upon entering the containment unit.</li>
        <li>When an employee with {Prudence} Level 4 or below finished the work, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>When the work time lasted 60 seconds or more, the Qliphoth Counter decreased, and the employee was sucked into the centre of the Abnormality.</li>
        <li>Employees with {Temperance} Level 2 or {Prudence} Level 3 or below were sucked in as soon they encountered the escaped Abnormality.</li>
        <li>While the Abnormality remained escaped, all sounds will diminish to a quiet, low-pitched hum and sight will be hindered.</li>
        <li>While the Abnormality remained escaped, all panicking employees in the facility will be sucked into the centre of the Abnormality and die.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>An urgent annnouncement to all personnel in our company. Lobotomy Corporation supports any program that promotes positivity. Recently however, we have received reports of group activities that have been planning unhealthy schemes. Due to an inflow of many allegations, we decided to formally investigate the matter.<br>
        By company policy, you are not allowed to idolize and/or worship any of the Abnormalities. You are not allowed to treat any being here as a subject of "idolization".</p>

        <p>Employees attempting to enter any containment unit without authorization will receive harsh punishment.<br>
        If you feel an impulse to pledge yourself towards a certain Abnormality, it means that you are under the influence of a certain "infection". As is the nature of some Abnormalities that are held here, it is part of the process of manipulating and misleading your brain. If this happens, please stop working and immediately seek mental treatment. As you all have passed basic employee training, we hope no one will be foolish enough to be misled.</p>

        <p>We are releasing a blacklist. Those who appear on this list must take 3 days of mental treatment provided by the company and will receive punishment accordingly as decided by the relevant Sephirah. The reason we are distributing this list is to bring to your attention the astonishing number of infected employees around you.<br>
        Calling Emily—who killed herself after breaking into the containment unit of a certain Abnormality—a "martyr" will be considered an act of non-compliance with the company’s rules.<br>
        In addition, we would like to praise employee Dylan for his courageousness in the rescue of employee Sophie, who was attempting to commit suicide. If you notice any of your coworkers displaying similar behavior to this, promptly report them to your Sephirah in charge.</p>

        <p>“Dear Dylan,<br>
        I don't believe you intentionally sold us and Sophie out. I'm sure you were just worried about Sophie. She's locked up now. I heard that that she repeatedly tried to escape, so they tied her to her bed.<br>
        Tell me, is it wrong to have faith?<br>
        We are all sinners, and the Blue Star is the only place that will accept us. We will cleanse our sins there.<br>
        We will all return to that place someday. It's an instinct. You may think Emily died after she threw herself into the Blue Star, but she only returned to her rightful place. She's a martyr. She became an eternal star.<br>
        The rise of a star means a brand new beginning. Don't you hear the sound of the everlasting trumpet?<br>
        When you are close to the star, you can hear the welcoming cheers and singing.<br>
        If we all return to that place, only the Blue Star will remain.<br>
        We will meet again as stars.”</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the third Abnormality on the {Floor of Religion}, unlocking {Breakdown Martyr}, {Breakdown Penance}, and {Awakening A Nostalgic Sound} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} does not directly participate in combat. It instead remains in the background, while the Shrine to the {abnoName} acts as its surrogate in the fight, though it cannot be attacked either. The main enemies in the encounter are the Worshippers of the {abnoName}. Four Worshippers participate in the fight, though every time one dies, they are replaced by a new Worshipper at the start of the next turn.</p>
      
      <p>Every character that becomes Staggered is sucked into the {abnoName} and dies. The Abnormality is suppressed once 10 characters are killed in this fashion, regardless of whether they are a librarian or a Worshipper.</p>

      <p>The Worshippers' attacks focus on inflicting Stagger damage to opponents, while recovering their own Stagger Resist. If a Woshipper has a low amount of Stagger Resist, they perform a kamikaze attack, throwing themself into the {abnoName} while changing the target's Stagger resistances to "Fatal". This death does not count towards the required 10.</p>

      <p>Every 3 turns, {abnoName} performs a mass attack changing the Stagger resistances of any targets that are hit to "Fatal". Every time a character is sucked up by the {abnoName}, their opponents recover Stagger Resist while their allies take Stagger damage.</p>
