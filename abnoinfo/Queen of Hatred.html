    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b>, also known as Magical Girl, has the appearance of a young girl wearing a frilly pink dress with big yellow eyes. It has long blue hair that gradates to purple near the end. Two strands of hair are curled away at the sides. The dress is adorned with small white wings at the shoulders, and a big pink bowtie. It also wears a heart-shaped ornament in its hair.</p>

      <p>The Abnormality usually has a cheery disposition, and has a strong desire to fight evil to bring love and peace to the world. To accomplish this, it is capable of using a variety of magic attacks using its staff.<br>
      However, if there are no threats for it to face, it begins to doubt the purpose of its existence. During this state, {abnoName} becomes hysteric and dissociative. If it continues to feel this way, it will eventually transform into a hostile entity.</p>

      <p>After transforming, {abnoName} resembles a winged snake with blue scales and a pink underbelly. Its wings are covered in fur and are lined with purple and pink feathers. Its back is lined with heart-shaped scales, with the tail is tipped with a cracked pink star. The Abnormality's eyes are empty black voids. A pair of arms are attached to its neck, possessing purple hands with long bony fingers. The small pink bowtie is the only vestige of its previous form.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 3-4 {BLACK} damage and produces a maximum of 22 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Attachment} (High) > {Instinct} (Common) > {Insight} (Common) > {Repression} (Very Low).</p>

      <p>If the facility reaches {Second Warning}, {abnoName} will teleport out of its containment unit to aid in the suppression of hostile entities. It will shoot stars from its staff, fire energy shots from its fingers, and even shoot out a large laser beam that will span across multiple rooms. All of its attacks will only deal damage to hostile entities, and will instead heal the HP and SP of any employees that are caught in the attack.<br>
      Once all enemies have been dealt with it, {abnoName} will voluntarily teleport back into its containment unit.</p>

      <p>After a Qliphoth Meltdown occurs, if less than three employees died since the last Qliphoth Meltdown, {abnoName} will become distressed at the lack of evil for it to fight, and its Qliphoth Counter will decrease.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 2.<br>Upon reaching 1, {abnoName} will go into hysteria, falling to the floor and muttering to itself. While it is in hysteria, the work success rate will be reduced. If 16+ {PE-Boxes} are generated after a work with it, the Qliphoth Counter will increase and it will return to its normal state. Failing to do this will instead decrease the Qliphoth Counter to 0.</p>

      <p>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} will be impaled by several red spears and will subsequently transform into its hostile form. This hostile form will teleport to a random room, dealing {BLACK} damage to everyone within the room. After taking a moment to charge, it will fire a beam from its mouth that will span across multiple rooms in the direction it is facing.<br>
      This laser deals continous {BLACK} damage to anyone caught in it and also reduces their movement speed. If the laser continues to deal damage, it will begin to grow wider and deal more damage. Damage dealt by this attack will also heal {abnoName}. After performing the attack, {abnoName} will become vulnerable as it collapses to the floor to recharge. Once it recovers, it will teleport away again to another room.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>When the work result was {Bad}, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>When less than 3 employees died before the Qliphoth Meltdown alert, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.</li>
        <li>When the Qliphoth Counter was at its maximum, the employee who finished the work had their HP and SP healed.</li>
        <li>When the facility reached {Second Warning}, {abnoName} voluntarily aided in suppression. However, if 20% of the employees died during the incident, the state of the Abnormality changed and required suppression.</li>
        <li>{abnoName}'s status changed when the Qliphoth Counter was at 1 and the work success rate decreased. This status has been dubbed "Hysteric" due to its anxiety and compulsive disorder.</li>
        <li>While hysetric, generating 16 or more {PE-Boxes} increased the Qliphoth Counter.</li>
        <li>While hysetric, generating less than 16 {PE-Boxes} decreased the Qliphoth Counter.</li>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>The Abnormality has the appearance of a young woman that is ready to fight any villain for peace and justice.</p>

        <p>It is generally polite and friendly to employees and often engages in casual conversation. It believes itself to be a hero sent to save the world and takes a considerable amount of pride in it.</p>

        <p>When it displays signs of anxiety of skepticism, its outer persona will undergo an adverse change within 2-4 days and it will display symptoms of dissociative disorders.</p>

        <p>The definition of 'good' and 'evil' are fixed within its mind. Some assume that when the Abnormality's beliefs lead to its doubt about the existence of evil, it chose to become evil itself to negate that doubt.</p>

        <p>Once the enraged phase has passed, it will have no memory of its own behaviour. There is no need to remind the Abnormality of past events.</p>

        <p>&lt;Audio Log - 1&gt;<br>
        Employee M-4032: “So, how are you today?”<br>
        Magical Girl: “Great! It's quiet here and the world is at peace. Peace is a good thing. It means there aren't any villains around, right?”</p>

        <p>&lt;Audio Log - 2&gt;<br>
        Employee M-4032: “You look a bit blue today.”<br>
        Magical Girl: “I'm still fine. The world is still peaceful and it's… (The Abnormality falls silent)”<br>
        (Omitted)<br>
        Employee M-4032: “Hey, are you alright?”<br>
        Magical Girl: “Why is it still so peaceful? I live to defeat evil. But the world doesn't need me at all, does it? Oh, did I mention that I'm a magical girl? I was sent to bring peace to the world. But it's already quiet today. (The Abnormality continued to murmur incomprehensibly to itself)”</p>

        <p>&lt;Audio Log - 3&gt;<br>
        (The Abnormality shows signs of anxiety and compulsive behaviour. It doesn't notice the employee entering the containment unit)<br>
        Magical Girl: “The world is divided into good and evil. I am on the side of justice. If I am good, then there must be evil too. Without evil, I cannot exist. Who would save the world then?”<br>
        (After displaying these symptoms, the Abnormality was sedated with enough anaesthetic to last 3 days)</p>

        <p>&lt;Audio Log - 4&gt;<br>
        Warning: Level 3 or higher access is required to read this report.<br>
        This recording was following Incident #XXXXX on X/X/XX. The Abnormality used the containment unit's emergency phone to contact an employee in the Emergency Response Department.<br>
        Magical Girl: (continuous sobbing)<br>
        Employee: “This is the Emergency Response Department. Please identify yourself.”<br>
        Magical Girl: “I… I did this. Oh, I- I couldn't stop myself. If anyone died, their blood is on my hands. I ruined everything. All those people who were so kind to me… I betrayed them. I don't remember…”<br>
        Employee: “What exactly happened?”<br>
        Magical Girl: “I don't know. They aren't moving. There's so much blood. I'm sorry, I just wanted to say sorry…”<br>
        (Omitted)<br>
        Three corpses were found in the Abnormality's containment unit. The bodies were of employees that had been assigned to prevent incidents. Afterwards, the Abnormality lost all memory of the incident.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of Natural Sciences}, unlocking {Awakening Love}, {Awakening Justice}, and {Breakdown Hate} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>On the first turn, {abnoName} will target a librarian with '<span class="hardcover">Arcana Beats</span>' marking them as a {LoR SE d Villain}. This librarian will have all their resistance set to "Weak" and the Abnormality will prioritize them as a target. {abnoName} will mark a new librarian either after 2 turns pass, or after the current {LoR SE d Villain} dies.<br>
      It will also use its mass attack, '<span class="hardcover">Arcana Slave</span>', every 4 turns which can be prove to be quite deadly to librarians already weary from the fight thus far.</p>
      
      <p>Additionally, {abnoName} has a hysteria guage represented by a pink filter applied to the background which will grow from left to right as the gauge rises. The Abnormality's hysteria will decrease whenever it attacks the {LoR SE d Villain} or beats them in clash. But the hysteria will increase whenever it is attacked by the {LoR SE d Villain} or loses to them in a clash.</p>

      <p>If the gauge ever fills, {abnoName} will transform into its serpentine form, fully recovering HP. This form follows the same behaviour, though its attacks have higher power. However, whenever this form uses '<span class="hardcover">Arcana Slave</span>', it will become Staggered the following turn, granting a valuable opportunity for damage.</p>
