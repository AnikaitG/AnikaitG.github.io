    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is a bathtub made of skin, filled with blood instead of water. It has an attachment on its left side resembling a shower, though in place of a shower head, there is instead a severed hand attached to the stand. The hand is covered in scars and blood can be seen slowly dripping from its fingers into the tub.</p>

      <p>The tub is supported by four legs. It is always filled with blood which never overflows. Like the severed hand, the tub is also covered in scars. Two large eyes are present on the front side of the tub. They are usually closed, only opening when attacking.</p>

      <p>When attacking, its eyes open wearing a pained look. Three pale hands stretch out from the blood in the tub and drag the victim inside, killing them. The victim disappears inside the tub, with only their severed hand surfacing.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 2-4 {WHITE} damage and produces a maximum of 14 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Attachment} (High) > {Instinct} (Common) > {Insight} (Common) > {Repression} (Very Low).<br>It perfers work performed by lower level agents.</p>
      
      <p>{abnoName} will kill any employee with Level 1 {Fortitude} or {Temperance} after they finish their work. Pale hands stretch out from the tub and drag the employee inside. Every time an employee is killed this way, a severed hand will appear floating in the tub. The number of hands increase the number of PE-Boxes {abnoName} produces, with a maximum of three hands at a time.</p>

      <p>When three hands are present in the tub, {abnoName} will instantly kill the next employee who finishes work on it. After this, all hands disappear from the tub, resetting the count back to 0.</p>
      
      <p>It does not have a Qliphoth Counter, and does not breach containment.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>When an employee with {Fortitude} Level 1 finished the work, a hand stetched out from {abnoName} and took them inside. The same occurred when an employee with {Temperance} Level 1 finished the work.</li>
        <li>After it absorbed the employee, a pale hand surfaced in the bath. As the number of hands increased, the number of PE-Boxes produced by {abnoName} also increased.</li>
        <li>&lt;Caution&gt; When three hands are present in {abnoName}, the safety of the next employee cannot be guaranteed. It seems they will be absorbed regardless of the conditions or work result.</li>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>A bath full of blood. The blood is always kept in equilibrium; it never overflows. Only despair can be found in its sunken depths.<br>An unbearable depression overwhelms you when you look into the bath. In an instant, it can pull the employee inside. It bears no considerable strength, but employees suffering from crushing depression offer no resistance. It devours the employee until nothing is left except for their wrists. The hands floating in the bath are pale. They reach out, as if asking for help.</p>

        <p>It isn't easy to cut your wrists with a sane mind. It takes strong willpower, as it requires multiple attempts. Only when you cut at it as if you were cutting a slab of meat, can you succeed. Only when you yearn for death that much, can you succeed.</p>

        <p>I regret not asking why, when she asked me for a knife. I regret not noticing that she was hiding her wrist with a watch. I regret not realising that she always hid her wrist when I talked to her. I regret not realising that, at some point, I could no longer hear her laughter.</p>

        <p>I can't even imagine how painful it must be to cut your own wrist. I found out the only reason she could manage it, was because she literally chopped her wrist off.</p>

        <p>We always popped a bottle of wine every time we succeeded. It became one of our customs. She told us that it only takes one slight misstep to fall into a habit if we got used to success. Thus, we should always celebrate every little success. And we shouldn't neglect our failures, as success can be born from a pile of failures.<br>
        When I saw the scars on her wrist, I recalled our wine cellar. Many of the bottles were gone, and there was only one left.<br>That day, I popped the cork off the last bottle.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of General Works}, unlocking {Breakdown Blood}, {Awakening Scars}, and {Awakening Pale Hands} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>Within its book, {abnoName} has a completely different appearance, instead appearing as a humanoid made of red scars. It lacks hands and feet, and as a black hole in place of a face. Instead, the battle background resembles {abnoName}'s true appearance, with its usual closed eyes appearing on the wall.</p>
      
      <p>{abnoName} is fairly bulky, being near impervious to Slash attacks and having boosted rolls for its block dice. There is also a chance for it to roll relatively high with '<span class="hardcover">Depression</span>' which inflicts the opponent with {LoR SE d Paralysis}, further crippling their offensive capabilities.</p>

      <p>'<span class="hardcover">Pale Hands</span>' will allow {abnoName} to Stagger its target should all 3 attacks hit. Should the Librarian get Staggered from this attack, the eyes in the background will open as well.</p>
