      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> has a red stalk leading to a big yellow eye. It has 'wings' that resemble thorny branches that are adorned in smaller yellow eyes similar in appearance to the main eye. The eyes are constantly looking forward, searching to meet another's gaze.</p>

      <p>The Abnormality desires attention and requires someone to maintain a gaze with it at all times. If it feels that it has lost attention, it will spread its wings and grow. It will pierce anyone in its path and use them as fertilizer to continue growing until someone gives it their gaze.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 4-5 {BLACK} damage and produces a maximum of 24 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Attachment} (Common) > {Repression} (Common) > {Insight} (Common) > {Instinct} (Very Low).</p>

      <p>{abnoName}'s Qliphoth Counter will decrease by 1 every 10 seconds while work is being performed on it outside of the camera's view. During this, its work success rate will also be fixed at 0% until it is returned to the camera's view.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 3.<br>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} will instantly kill the employee in the containment unit that was working with it, and teleport to a random room that has employees. {abnoName} will not move or act while it is in view of the camera, allowing employees to safely suppress it. However if it remains out of the camera's view for 3 seconds, it will deal heavy {BLACK} damage to all employees in the room and teleport to another room.</p>

      <p>Whenever Burrowing Heaven kills an employee, it will leave a Heaven's Thorn behind. The Heaven's Thorn is a smaller and passive version of the Abnormality that will remain in the room. Parts of the employee's corpse will be adorned on the Thorn as if it were bearing fruit.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Work with {abnoName} must be performed while the manager is viewing the containment unit.</li>
        <li>During the work, when the containment unit went out of the surveillance camera's sight, the Qliphoth Counter decreased. When the containment unit remained unmonitored, the Qliphoth Counter continued to decrease.</li>
        <li>When the work result was {Normal} or {Good}, the Qliphoth Counter increased. It seems the Counter can be increased up to 2 levels at a time, depending on the work result.</li>
        <li>&lt;Warning&gt; While the Abnormality's suppression is in progress, do not look away from it.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>An Abnormality made of thorns that feeds on the gaze of others to spread its wings.</p>

        <p>Don't look away, just keep your eyes on it.<br>
        It lives inside your eyes. The containment unit is meaningless.<br>
        Contain it within your sight.<br>
        Blinking is okay. It will tolerate a brief lapse.<br>
        But when it believes that it has lost your attention and focus, it will spread its wings.<br>
        Yes, wings.<br>
        As if paying tribute to an old forgotten god, its bloody wings will spread out, covering the entire corridor.<br>
        Its wings will bear fruit, using fresh corpses as fertilizer.<br>
        If it still fails to catch your attention, the stalks will extend towards the sunny sky, piercing the company in the process.<br>
        Like an angel, its wings will extend towards the sky and block out the sun.<br>
        But there's still hope. When you finally turn your eyes to it and bring it within your cognizance…<br>
        It will return to the deep, dark underground.<br>
        That is, if you're still alive.</p>

        <p>That's what a gaze is. Attention. An invisible string that connects us. Full focus.<br>
        Don't come here, there's no place here for you to rest.<br>
        But you see, I could finally bear fruit only when I'm within your sight.<br>
        Isn't this what you wanted?<br>
        When your tears dry, let me know your answer.</p>

      <h3 class="profile-header">Library of Ruina</h3>
      <hr class="header-seperator">

      <div class="page-img-container">
        <a class="display-img" href="../images/abnos/The Burrowing Heaven/LoR Idle.png" data-lightbox="LoRIdle" data-title="{abnoName}"><img class="page-img" src="../images/abnos/The Burrowing Heaven/LoR Idle.png"/></a>
        <div class="caption">{abnoName} in Library of Ruina</div>
      </div>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the first Abnormality on the {Floor of Religion}, unlocking {Awakening Bloody Wings}, {Breakdown Gaze of Others}, and {Breakdown Attention and Focus} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, {abnoName} is accompanied by three Heaven's Thorns. All enemies exclusively user Counter dice, meaning they cannot be attacked without clashing them. Additionally, the Heaven's Thorns continuously inflict {LoR SE d Feeble} on to attacking librarians, while the Burrowing Heaven inflicts a fixed 10 {LoR SE d Feeble} whenever it is active.<br>
      This means direct attacks to the Abnormalities will be largely unsuccessful. Instead, they must each be Staggered throught deflects. To aid with this, all of them take double Stagger damage from deflects.</p>
      
      <p>Initially only one Heaven's Thorn is active while all other enemies lie {LoR SE r Dormant}, meaning they do not act and cannot be targeted. After every 4 turns, another Heaven's Thorn will become active. The previous Thorn must be killed before another wakes as whenever a librarian engages in combat against another enemy, the Thorn will deal heavy damage to all librarians. This is unavoidable if there are multiple Thorns active at the same time.</p>

      <p>If a Thorn is Staggered, the counter for the next Thorn to wake will be paused for that turn to allow the previous one to be defeated. If a Thorn is defeated well in advance before the next one can wake, {abnoName} will become temporarily active allowing the librarians to chip away at its Stagger Resist.<br>
      Once all 3 Heaven's Thorns have been defeated, {abnoName} will properly awake and use its mass attack, '<span class="workofart">Your Own Heaven</span>'. If it is not defeated within 3-4 turns, it will begin spawning a Heaven's Thorn every 3 turns.</p>
