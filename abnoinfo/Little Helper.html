      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> is a small, white cleaning robot. It has an oval-shaped bodies with two red eyes and a small smile. When in an idle state, the body is supported by a pair of metal legs. It has a variety of functions installed in its body designed to help out a household with their daily chores.</p>

      <p>When it detects a bad mood, it will enter cleaning mode. Due to a technical malfunction, {abnoName} will pull out sharp blades instead of cleaning supplies when it enters cleaning mode. Its legs further extend, and an additional pair also extends out from the top of its body. Each of the four legs is tipped with a sharp, blood-stained blade.</p>
      
      <p>As part of its 'cleaning', {abnoName} will spin around baring its blades, slicing anything in its path. Due to its pattern recognition system, it understands human screams as a sign of a job well done which encourages it to continue 'cleaning'.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 3-5 {RED} damage and produces a maximum of 16 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Instinct} (Common) = {Repression} (Common) > {Attachment} (Low) > {Insight} (Very Low).<br>It perfers work performed by lower level agents.</p>
      
      <p>Its Qliphoth Counter starts at 2.<br>Upon reaching 0, {abnoName} enters cleaning mode and breaches containment. It will wander the facility, spinning around with its bladed limbs. When it is in a room with another entity, it will start spinning in place before quickly charging at the target.<br>
      Once it hits the end of the room after its charge attack, it will stop spinning and enter recharge mode, giving employees an opportunity to safely attack it.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>A white cleaning robot, with distinct red eyes that look like a pair of buttons. It always keeps its surroundings neat and tidy. "Manufactured by X Corp." is written on its back.</p>

        <p>It was originally a mass produced helper robot. “An innovative invention that can clean, cook, and even serve as light security, this robot is all you need to keep your home safe and in tiptop condition!”</p>

        <p>It recognises bad moods as a "dirty environment" and will enter cleaning mode. When it goes into cleaning mode it will alert its status by saying “Contamination detected. Commencing cleaning.” However, instead of cleaning supplies, it deploys sharp instruments that were installed in its body, like knives and saws, to carry out the cleaning.<br>
        Apparently, these tools were supposed to be used for cutting and preparing meat, but the commands registered to the tools for cooking and cleaning had been 'accidentally' switched. No official comment has been made regarding this.</p>

        <p>Due to its faulty pattern recognition and analysis feature, it has determined that the screaming people make after it cleans is a sign of a job well done, and a cue to continue its cleaning.</p>

        <p>&lt;Audio Recording within the Robot&gt;<br>
        ??: Oh, it's the new helper robot!<br>
        ??: Let me see, let me see!<br>
        ??: You want to try it, sweetheart? Here, go on and play with it.<br>
        (A phone rings)<br>
        ??: &lt;Redacted&gt;, hon, I'll be right back after I get the phone, okay?<br>
        (Sounds of buttons being pressed)<br>
        Helper Robot: Hello! I am your friendly Helper Robot. How may I help you?
        ??: Cleaning! I want to help mommy with cleaning!<br>
        Helper Robot: Environment containimation 70%, filth level mild. Commencing cleaning. Beep, beep.<br>
        ??: Wow! It's cleaning! It's clean-<br>
        Helper Robot: Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br>
        The recoding stops after a few seconds of screaming.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the second Abnormality on the {Floor of Technology}, unlocking {Awakening Recharge}, {Awakening Repetitive Pattern-Recognition}, and {Awakening Clean} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, there are three {abnoName}s present, all of which are in cleaning mode. Its strategy involves using '<span class="hardcover">Charge</span>' to gain 4 {LoR SE b Strength} to boost the power of '<span class="hardcover">Clean</span>'.</p>
      
      <p>With the additional power, '<span class="hardcover">Clean</span>' becomes able to deal 10 damage to the opponent. This activates its passive 'Repetitive Pattern-Recognition' which generates extra {Light}, enabling it to use '<span class="hardcover">Clean</span>' the following turn as well.</p><br><br>
