      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> appears as a full-length standing mirror, set in a metallic frame and propped up by a wooden stand. The surface of the mirror is completely black and has a swirl pattern.<br>
      The mirror only reflects people, and nothing else. When someone stands in front of the mirror, they change. Though they look the same, they have different behaviours and capabilities.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} is a Tool-type Abnormality and does not produce Enkephalin. An employee can look into the mirror, after which their basic stats ({Fortitude}, {Prudence}, {Temperance}, {Justice}) will be totalled and redistributed randomly.<br>
      However, if an employee uses the mirror again, some stats will be lost during the redistribution and the total will be lower than before. This will occur for each additional time the mirror is used by that employee.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Method</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Subjects who face the {abnoName} will have their stats randomly adjusted.</li>
        <li>If an employee faces the {abnoName} more than once a day, all of their stats will be lowered each time they face it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Log</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The mirror only reflects people, nothing else is shown in it.</li>
        <li>When facing oneself in the mirror, the subject changes. There are numerous suggestions, like possibilities from parallel universes but this cannot be confirmed.</li>
        <li>The subject who faces the mirror may appear the same, but in actuality, they become a completely different person.</li>
        <li>When looking into the mirror multiple times, the subject's humanity taken away, essentially turning them into a walking husk.</li>
        <li>“Hey, Brian just completely ignored me and walked away without saying a word. What's up with him?”<br>“Oh, he stared into the mirror. He always complained about being born too weak. Guess he finally made up his mind.”<br>Satisfaction is only temporary.</li>
