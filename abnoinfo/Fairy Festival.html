    <section class="abno-intro">
      <p><b>{abnoName}</b> comprises of a cluster of entities taking the appearance of small glowing fairies with aquamarine colored skin. They have a pair of white button eyes, and light green hair with twintails. Each fairy possesses two pairs of arms, a long tail, and two sets of insect wings. They wear an armlet around each of their arms, as well as their tail.</p>

      <p>When the fairies like someone, due to the person being kind or good-natured, they will provide them with their 'care'. When caring for an individual, the fairies will emit a dust with healing properties to keep the subject in good health. However, the true purpose of their care is to keep the meat fresh for later consumption. If the fairies are hungry, or worried that something else will steal their meal, they will swarm around their victim and tear into them with their sharp teeth.</p>

      <p>If the fairies are unable to find a meal for themselves, they are known to cannibalize on each other, collectively preying on the weakest of their kind.</p>

      <p>In containment, {abnoName} deals 1-2 {RED} damage and produces a maximum of 10 {E-Boxes}.<br>Its responses to the four work orders are as follows:<br>{Instinct} (High) > {Attachment} (Common) > {Insight} (Low) = {Repression} (Low).<br>It perfers work performed by lower level agents, except for {Instinct} which has a consistent success rate.</p>

      <p>When an employee achieves a {Normal} or {Good} work result, they will followed by a small cluster of fairies that will periodically heal the employee every few seconds for a short duration before disappearing. If the employee is assigned to work with any other Abnormality (aside from {abnoName}) while under the effect of the fairies' care, the fairies will immediately consume the employee on the spot.</p>
      
      <p>It does not have a Qliphoth Counter, and does not breach containment.</p>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Managerial Guidelines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>When the work result was {Normal} or {Good}, small fairies appeared around the employee.</li>
        <li>The small fairies healed the employee's HP over a limited duration.</li>
        <li>If an employee under the fairies' care is assigned to work with another Abnormality, they will immediately die and be consumed by the fairies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="profile-subheader">Abnormality Story</h5>
      <div class="abno-story">
        <p>The Abnormality is similar to a fairy, having two pairs of wings and a small body. They act as a cluster.</p>

        <p>They use a language we cannot understand to communicate with each other. They follow a few employees around after they enter the containment unit and use their special abilities to heal them. Employees refer to this as "The Fairies' Care".</p>

        <p>The fairies protect our employees. If you often act out of the goodness of your heart and are a lover of nature, then the fairies will happily take care of you. Everything will be peaceful while you are under the fairies' care. (Also, you can enjoy being the envy of other employees. Not that that's imporant, but still…).<br>
        And if the fairies don't approach you? Then you should reflect on your life. When Emil and I took shifts working with the fairies, they never hesitated approaching me. Just me, and never Emil (You all know how Emil is. Why, even yesterday he refused to share his snacks with me and acted all high and mighty).<br>
        It is considered sacred to be protected by fairies in any world. But don't enter their containment unit just for fun. If you've read a few books, you'll know that fairies don't like people who take advantage of their kindness.
        </p>

        <p>The following document is only accessible to Employees Level 4 and above.<br>
        When Walter, who was under the care of the fairies, died in the containment unit of another Abnormality, we noticed some anomalies. His stomach and face were ripped off, and his eyeballs and organs had seemingly been consumed by something. Moreover, the containment unit Walter was found in was for an Abnormality that only uses psychological attacks. Fairies were found in a nearby area, having blood and flesh smeared all over their mouths. We did not bother to perform tests to find out whose flesh and blood it was.<br>
        In our world, there are very few things that are done out of pure kindness. Fairies that live in the forest visiting you just because they like you or because you did many good deeds is something that only happens in fairy tales. Even though we know this to be true, we still sometimes become deluded. Thinking that "The Fairies' Care" is being given to you because of all the good things you've done throughout your life, or that the fairies are favouring you because there is something more special about you than the other employees.</p>

        <p>In truth, fairies are just monsters that like meat. They protect you because they want to keep their food fresh. When an employee heads to work in a different containment unit, they gobble the employee up in fear that they would lose their meal to something else.<br>
        But most of the employee that received the fairies' care were greatly satisfied. Furthermore, the casualty rate greatly reduced due to the fairies' care which is a big positive for the company. Therefore, it has been decided that the employees will not be made aware of the full truth.</p>

      <p>{abnoName} appears as the third Abnormality on the {Floor of History}, unlocking {Breakdown The Fairies’ Care}, {Awakening Gluttony}, and {Breakdown Predation} after its suppression.</p>

      <p>In its book, the fairies take a wildly different appearance due to prolonged starvation, giving them a skinny appearance. Groups of fairies are fused together to form a Fairy Mass. The head of each Mass is an amalgam of faces with multiple eyes and three sets of mouths each baring sharp teeth. It possesses two pairs of legs, with the fingers and feet transformed into claws. It has tattered wings, and is covered in blood.</p>

      <p>One fairy, the Fairy Queen, is much larger than the Masses and acts as their leader. It is hunched over, using a pair of long clawed arms and a singular enlongated leg to support itself. Its second pair of arms are relatively much smaller and hang from the front of its body.</p>

      <p>In the fight, the Fairy Queen is joined by three Fairy Masses. All the fairies have attacks that either inflict {LoR SE d Bleed} or restore HP. The Fairy Masses cannot be killed, and can only be brought down to 1 HP. In addition, the Masses recover HP at the start of each turn.<br>
      If a Mass has the {LoR SE r Prepared Meat} status and is at 1 HP at the end of a turn, it will be consumed by the Fairy Queen in order to prevent the meat from going to waste.</p>

      <p>After eating a Fairy Mass, the Fairy Queen will become momentarily satiated and become weakened by severe debuffs. This provides an opportune moment to deal damage to it as it is usually too strong to face directly. Once the Queen is brought down to 25% health, it will consume any remaining allies and subsequently gain 30 {LoR SE b Strength} and {LoR SE b Haste} each turn. At this point, the Fairy Queen must be dealt with swiftly before it can deal too much damage.</p>
